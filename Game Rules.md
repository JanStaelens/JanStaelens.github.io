# Character Creation

- **Starting Level**: Characters will begin the campaign at level 3, allowing for more developed backstories and immediate access to class-specific abilities and features.
- **Initial Stats**: Each character starts with one stat at 10, and all other stats at 8.
- **Point Allocation**: Players receive 26 points to distribute among their stats.
- **Maximum Stat Value**: No stat can exceed 18 after point allocation.

### Rules for Point Allocation:

1. Choose one stat to set at 10.
2. Distribute 26 points among the remaining stats, adhering to the following guidelines:
    - Each point increases a stat by 1.

# Session Rules

Due to the size of the party, several house rules are introduced on an experimental basis. These rules are meant to enhance our gameplay experience, ensuring it remains enjoyable and engaging for everyone involved. During our first session, we will discuss each rule in detail, providing everyone with the opportunity to voice their opinions. This collaborative approach will help us decide whether to implement these rules permanently or adjust them as needed.

### Potions

To streamline gameplay and add a tactical layer to combat, we're modifying how potions can be used:

- **Self-administration**: Drinking a potion yourself is considered a bonus action. This change allows for more flexibility during combat, enabling characters to heal or gain buffs without sacrificing their main actions.
- **Assisting Others**: Giving a potion to another character requires a full action. This rule emphasizes the tactical decision-making involved in supporting allies during combat, reflecting the time and effort needed to ensure a companion consumes the potion properly.

### Last Stand Mechanic

Introducing a new mechanic for characters brought down to 0 hitpoints, aimed at keeping the game dynamic and giving players a chance to influence the battle even in the brink of unconsciousness:

- **Reactionary Effort**: When a character is reduced to 0 hitpoints, they may use their reaction to perform a last "attack" or action before falling unconscious. This could be an actual attack, a spell with a casting time of 1 action (or shorter), or a final shout for help.
- **Balance Adjustments**:
    - **Disadvantaged Attacks**: Any attack made as part of this last stand mechanic is at disadvantage, reflecting the character's weakened state.
    - **Advantaged Enemy Saves**: If the last stand action involves a spell or effect that requires an enemy to make a saving throw, the enemy makes this saving throw with advantage. 
    - **Exhaustion Penalty**: Invoking the Last Stand mechanic results in the character gaining 1 level of exhaustion upon being stabilized or regaining consciousness. This represents the physical toll of pushing themselves beyond their limits.
    

    - This action does not prevent the character from falling unconscious or suffering death saving throws as usual.
    - To maintain balance, this last stand action cannot include the use of items or abilities that would prevent the character from dropping to 0 hitpoints.

> This mechanic is meant to reflect a desperate effort or final act of defiance, adding to the narrative depth of combat.

### Preparation Points

**Mechanic**: At the start of each session, each player receives a set number of Preparation Points (e.g., 3). Players can spend a Preparation Point to gain a small, one-time bonus during their turn, such as:
- An extra +1 to any roll (attack roll, saving throw, skill check, etc.).
- A slight increase in movement speed for that turn (e.g., +5 feet).
- An additional minor action or interaction with the environment.

**Condition**: A player can only use a Preparation Point on their turn if they declare their intended action within approximately 15 seconds of their turn starting, at the Dungeon Master's discretion. This flexible time frame encourages players to think about their next move ahead of time, while allowing for slight adjustments based on the DM's judgment and the pace of the game.

### Discussion and Adaptation

These rules are designed with the intent to enhance our gameplay experience, adding both tactical depth and narrative richness. However, they are experimental and subject to discussion and change. Feedback is crucial, and adjustments will be made based on the group's consensus to ensure that our game remains as enjoyable and engaging as possible for everyone.

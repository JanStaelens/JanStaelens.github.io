## The Divine Gate

The Divine Gate is a metaphysical barrier that separates the Material Plane from the divine realms of the gods.

Created after the Calamity to prevent gods from directly influencing the mortal world, it allows deities to grant powers and communicate with their followers without physically manifesting. This ensures a balance between divine intervention and mortal free will, enabling mortals to shape their destinies while still under the guidance of their gods. The Divine Gate is central to the relationship between the divine and the mortal, symbolizing a covenant of trust and autonomy.

> "In every whisper of the wind and every flame that dances in the night, the Divine Gate speaks to us. It reminds us that though the gods may reside beyond, their essence permeates our world. So fear not the distance, for in faith, we are ever close." - Elder Caius Marrowroot


## The Prime Deities

Prime Deities are Exandria's benevolent gods, guiding creation and morality.

Comprising a diverse pantheon, these deities fought alongside their mortal devotees against the Betrayer Gods during the Calamity, a cataclysmic conflict that reshaped the world. In the aftermath, to prevent such destruction from recurring, they established the Divine Gate, a barrier limiting their direct interaction with the mortal realm while still guiding and empowering their followers through faith. Each deity embodies specific aspects of existence—ranging from the sun, nature, and civilization to knowledge, the forge, and the sea—ensuring a balance of powers and influence across the cosmos. Their teachings, though varied, commonly advocate for principles of good, order, and compassion, influencing countless cultures, traditions, and individuals across Exandria.

They seldom cooperate, viewing each other as threats rather than allies. This disunity was their downfall, allowing the Prime Deities to defeat and exile them, thus ending the Calamity. Their legacy is one of conflict and ambition, forever shaping the darker corners of Exandria's history.

## **Session 16: The Wishing Well**

### **Breaking In**

The group infiltrated the Wishing Well Casino by smashing a side window and prying open a door with Abokar's trusty crowbar, Betsy. Inside, they entered the grand two-story casino, dominated by a towering glass maze resembling a hall of mirrors, suspended over metal grates. Echoing voices drifted from below, hinting at hidden activity. Sensing urgency, Viola and Idris decided to act. Idris hurled a rock at the maze wall, causing a loud crack that silenced the voices. Idris briefly caught the sound of scuffling and a rock scraping against stone.

### **Splitting Up**

The party divided to cover more ground. Abokar discovered a massive iron chain descending through a hole in the floor and vanishing into a cramped shaft beneath the maze. Unable to follow it below, he decided to trace it upstairs. Ruby found a staircase leading to a balcony overlooking the maze. Suspended above the labyrinth were four wooden rigs holding buckets—three filled with water, one glinting with gold. Meanwhile, Nickolas and Rono uncovered a series of levers behind the bar and a heavy, reinforced door. Viola, determined to find the source of the voices, ventured outside.

### **Navigating the Maze**

Ruby's discovery of the gold-filled bucket piqued Idris's interest. To Viola's frustration, Idris abandoned the chase to navigate the maze. With Ruby's shouted guidance, he stumbled through the glass corridors, occasionally smacking into walls. Eventually, Idris reached the bucket. Recognizing that tipping it would spill the coins through the grate, he deftly climbed the glass walls and cut the bucket free, securing about 50 gold pieces. As he prepared to leave, the glass beneath him shifted, causing him to slip. A rising glass panel struck him in the face, leaving him bruised.

### **The Chain Mechanism**

Abokar ascended to the first floor, locating a heavy iron door. Betsy once again proved invaluable, prying it open to reveal a towering chamber. Suspended near the ceiling, a colossal boulder hung from thick iron chains. A ship-like wheel nearby controlled the chains. Curious, Abokar turned the wheel, causing the boulder to inch upward until it reached its peak. Satisfied but wary, he turned to leave when the entire mechanism groaned to life—the boulder began its slow descent as massive gears clanked into motion.

### **The Storeroom and Traps**

Nickolas and Rono breached the reinforced door, revealing a storeroom stocked with food and drink. Hidden among crates, Nickolas discovered a trapdoor. Attempting to open it triggered a deadly trap—spears shot down from the ceiling, narrowly missing them. Ruby joined them but was more interested in stuffing her bag of holding with supplies than solving puzzles.

### **The Levers in Action**

Rono theorized the levers behind the bar controlled the hatch. Experimenting, he pulled them, causing the entire building to tremble. Gears whirred, and the glass maze shifted, transforming into a new configuration. This startled Abokar and resulted in Idris taking the painful hit from moving glass. Yet, the hatch remained locked.

### **Viola's Discovery**

Outside, Viola tried rallying the gathering crowd, but only two eager teens offered to help. Scanning the area, she noticed a shadowy figure reflected in the water at the bottom of the nearby well. Summoning a small spirit, she confirmed an expansive chamber beneath. Sending the teens off with a cryptic message for Lord Greystone, Viola hurried back inside.

### **Pressure and Decisions**

Viola arrived just as Rono shot open the hatch. She urged the group to explore the well's depths, but Abokar had already charged down the hatch. Torn between options, the group followed Abokar, leaving Viola trailing behind.

### **Face to Face with Danger**

The underground storeroom was crammed with mechanical parts, chains, and glass panels. Racing ahead, Abokar nearly ran into a massive gelatinous cube. It attacked, engulfing him and causing severe acid burns. Nickolas cleverly used a chair to block another cube. After a fierce battle, the group defeated the creatures, salvaging partially digested documents from the ooze.

### **Hidden Paths**

Determined to uncover their quarry's escape route, the group began smashing through sections of the glass maze, focusing on walls near the well. Idris eventually stumbled upon a hidden lever in the storeroom, revealing a concealed passage. The group quickly followed, entering a dust-choked, claustrophobic tunnel system. Viola voiced her confusion about how their quarry had used the hidden lever without leaving obvious signs. Ruby speculated that a strategically placed crate had been used to disguise the lever.

### **A Deadly Trap**

Rono, overhearing Ruby and Idris debating through the thin walls, decided to pull the lever again. This time, it swung open a hidden door and silently armed a deadly trap. As Viola stepped forward, the ground gave way beneath her feet. She barely managed to leap back in time, narrowly avoiding a pit lined with vicious, upward-pointing spears. The group froze, staring down into the dark, deadly trap.

### **Definitely Just a Chest, Not a Mimic**

In the depths, Idris attempted to unlock a chest, only to be ensnared by a mimic. Ruby intervened, shielding him from the creature's gnashing maw. The group swiftly dispatched the mimic, recovering a few gold pieces and two healing potions.

### **The Chase Continues Through the Sewers**

Pressing on, the group emerged into Kymal’s sewers. Tracking footprints beneath the marketplace, they realized the well above drained into the sewers. They reached a nexus where four sets of tracks diverged into separate tunnels. Abokar led them down the heaviest trail, while Ruby doubled back to retrieve Viola. Together again, they steeled themselves to pursue their quarry into the dark depths.

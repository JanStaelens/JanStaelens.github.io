## Of Blue Smoke And Flying Cats

### The Interrogation of Joyce

The group, standing in a semi-circle around a homeless woman, began their interrogation in the quarantined area within South-Goldhoard. She said her name was Joyce and that she'd been living in that ruined mansion for a good while now. Greasing the wheels with some money, food, and a decent amount of intimidation, they discovered that another homeless person, a man by the name of Raffael, was squatting in the destroyed house across the street. Raffael used to be a smith until most of the metal from the mining tunnels started drying up. He lost his home and most of his money and has been scraping by and squatting in that abandoned house for a while. She didn't really talk much with him except to perhaps share information to help survive.

She mentioned having seen his house explode a week or so ago and the guards soon after quarantining the area. She hid and stayed because, in her own words, the lack of people made her feel safer than elsewhere in the city; she just stayed away from the other house.

It turns out Raffael often had periods of depression followed by better days, and he'd recently developed a twitch. Every week or so, a man that walked with purpose would visit Raffael for some unknown reason. The man was rather loud, walked briskly, and carried a distinct cane that had the carving of a bear on top of it. She described him as wearing a dark black cloak and usually being hooded and covering his face with a cloth. Whoever it was, he never stayed for longer than maybe 15 minutes before briskly leaving for elsewhere.

Abokar handed the woman 5 gold pieces, telling her to go stay at the Muddy Boot Inn. The woman was shocked at the amount of money and agreed to do so (it was later discovered, she did not actually go to the Inn).

### Checking out the Abandoned House

The house was filled with large cobwebs, strong enough that they could hold a brick thrown at them. So the group was agitated and on the lookout for spiders that could spin such webs.

When entering the abandoned house that Raffael was living in, Idris noticed in the back a strange blue smoke that he recognized. He mentioned to the group he saw a similar glow after a short and unfortunate trip in the Shadowfell a while back. The glow was present and helped get him home but then disappeared as he stood on the side of a road next to a corpse.

When entering the house fully, Idris lost his footing and fell through the rotted floor into the basement of the house where he discovered that every valuable item that may have once been there was taken. Boxes broken, old barrels empty, ...

Viola ran around the house and discovered a back door that was closer to the source of the glow, and she discovered it seemed to emanate like smoke from a cocooned corpse of a man lying against the half-broken wall.

Abokar managed to find the right paths and stronger floor. He ignited his axe and used its fire to clear a way through the cobwebs, leading the way for others in the group.

Ruby had cast Detect Magic and, when closer to the body of the man, discovered the smoke to be magic. When prying deeper into its arcane secrets, she discovered something unseen to her. The magic seemed to mostly be the 'absence' of magic and every magic school, wildly shifting between different schools of magic or even to unknown things.

### There's the spider

![A_scene_in_a_Dungeons_ _Dragons_5e_style_latest_converted](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/c0bdbc3f-37ee-4181-86b1-1469fb1b2a6e)

Nickolas had found some strong larger planks and was helping clear the way from cobwebs when everyone suddenly heard the short scream of pain from both Idris and an unknown monstrous creature from down in the basement.

In a panic, Viola transformed into a bear, ran through the backdoor, and jumped through the bad floor to attack anything arrayed against them. She unfortunately dropped straight on the paralyzed body of Idris, causing it to begin bleeding out.

Abokar jumped down with his axe on fire, Ruby produced several balls of light illuminating the scene, and Nickolas immediately saved Idris through healing magic. The group was worried though, because despite the bleeding having stopped, Idris was unmoving and his veins were bulging and discolored. Before anything else could happen, a huge monster of a spider 'popped' into existence in the corner of the room and it bit into Abokar's neck, attempting to similarly poison and paralyze him as was done previously to Idris.

With a combined effort of the group, the 'phase spider' was defeated, and the group began tending to Idris and discussing visiting the temple for assistance.

### The blue smoke has an effect
They decided to first finish the investigation, so they tied a safety rope to the leg of the bear and around the torso of Abokar as he bravely stepped into the blue smoke surrounding the body of what was assumed to be Raffael.

There was a loud crack and a quick shift of the blue smoke into Idris, and to everyone's surprise, the limp body of Idris began flying around as if under intelligent control. This shocked Ruby into firing unknown damaging magic towards Idris that caused Idris to quickly fly, still paralyzed, to a corner of the room to stay very still.

### A greasy parchment burned with a snake symbol
The blue glow and smoke had disappeared, and Abokar was able to retrieve a parchment folded up. When Nickolas investigated, they discovered remnants of Hum Dust, similar to the impure sample shown by Lord Greystone. The parchment was peculiar as it was greasy on the inside and it had the signature burned into it of a coiled serpent.

### Who Knows?

![A_close-up_scene_in_a_Dungeons_ _Dragons_5e_style_latest_converted](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/e04f1afe-932d-4d41-931b-45e0ae01ac74)

After a brainstorming session between the group, Ruby and Nickolas eventually remembered that there was a shop called the Serpent's Quill that sold all sorts of papers, parchment, and other writing equipment. Before leaving, the group managed to piece together a rough timeline of what had happened and they came to the conclusion the man died first, then the house exploded. It also seems like the blue smoke was slowly reappearing from parts of the body and surroundings that slowly degrade. The party decided to head to the temple to heal Idris when Idris began to slowly fight off the poison on his own. He was soon flying, walking and talking on his own again. At that point, the temple was no longer required, so the group continued discussing their next steps and headed to the Inn when the group noticed a sound and a roof tile suddenly sliding down above them.

Expecting they were being spied on, Idris immediately scaled the house to the roof (after discovering he lost the ability to fly), and together with Ruby's flying squirrel, they heard and tried chasing a running person down the streets below but were eventually unable to follow.

The group followed the tracks of the running person in the mud all the way to the cobblestone streets that lead deeper into the town. The tracks became impossible to follow at this point. Suspicious of who might have sent someone to follow them, the group decided to head back to the Muddy Boot Inn and further discuss plans there. Suspects were thrown around; Lord Greystone may have sent someone? Perhaps Huxley, the captain of the guards? The servants of Greystone or perhaps the homeless lady had said something? At this point, they met up with Rono Cley, their other companion who waiting at the Muddy Boot Inn for the group and what they had discovered.

### A nights rest and weird dreams
The group, after discussing things, decided to rest for the night and meet up at the well in front of the casino The Wishing Well the next morning as the sun rises.

Viola invited Idris to relax with a massage at her place and sleep there, in order to help heal from the stress and troubles he received. Abokar retired to his own house, not too far away, while Ruby, Nickolas, and Rono decided to (reluctantly for some) rent rooms at the Muddy Boot Inn from Lisa, the owner of the inn.

Idris ended up having strange dreams about flying around, blue smoke, and his hands turning blue and eventually about his parents in the dusty plains of his homeworld explaining how the spirits can be a boon to us but also dangerous. And that he should never forget to ... at that point his dream cut out completely and the rest of his night was blackness.

### The Serpent's Quill

In the morning, the group got together at the well, keeping a suspicious eye out for any spies or shady characters following them. Under the guidance of Nickolas and Ruby, who had visited the shop before to purchase parchment, they found and entered the Serpent's Quill. Inside, they were greeted by the owner of the shop, a diminutive gnome, with bright, inquisitive eyes who wore his glasses very deep down on his nose. They caught him, with thread and needle, busy at his workstation, binding a book.

When initially questioned, he disclosed that he does indeed create special parchments with oils and greases to protect it and isolate things. Making parchment waterproof, for example, or being able to help hold dangerous materials.

When asked about his clientele, he was very reluctant to share. He takes the confidentiality of all his clients very seriously.

The session ends with the group standing in the Serpent's Quill shop and considering how to approach the situation and find the information they need about the shady man with the bear-topped cane.

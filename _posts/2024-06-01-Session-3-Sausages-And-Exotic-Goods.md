## Sausages And Exotic Goods

### The Serpent's Quill

The group talks with the gnome Eldwin Fizzlebang, but she won't give up the name of who buys the special parchment. Abokar and Viola end up putting pressure on the shopkeeper by blocking her shop and redirecting customers away, claiming they are conducting a murder investigation.

Ruby ends up buying the information through pressure from the group and a significant amount of coin, alongside a ruby-colored waterproof spellbook and ink. Eldwin keeps all her sales in a ledger with the names of the buyers. Ruby checks the names and sees several purchases by one Jasper Quickfoot for *H-D Parchment - Handle With Care - Greased*.

### Tracking Down Jasper

After asking around for an hour or so, they eventually find a farmer who likes drinking at a tavern called The Shaded Alley, which caters more to the locals. He remembers seeing a guy there with a walking cane that has a carved bear. Viola inquires further, discovering that such walking canes are probably sold at The Fox's Fancy, a unique wood workshop that creates customized and affordable walking canes and wood carvings. Abokar knows of the place. The Shaded Alley is owned by an elf named Selene Nightshade and is known as a spot away from most tourists. It's open 24/7 and usually managed by Selene in the evenings. It's also known as a place where you can find almost anything for the right price if you talk to the right people.

The group decides to split up: Viola, Idris, and Ruby go to check out The Shaded Alley, while Abokar and Nickolas track down The Fox's Fancy.

### The Shaded Alley

Viola, Idris, and Ruby arrive at The Shaded Alley, a tavern located between a poorer area and the rich marketplace and casino streets. They make sure not to arrive at the same time, with Viola taking up an oversight position without being seen.

As noon approaches, the place gets very busy with locals who work at shops or casinos popping in for a bite to eat and relax. A well-known sausage cart in front of the tavern, owned by Thalor Ironfist, has a long line of customers. The tavern isn't packed yet, but it's getting busier by the minute.

Idris uses his mystical talents to turn Ruby invisible. She successfully weaves through the people to enter the tavern unseen. The barkeep, a green-behind-the-ears young lad, is stressed and trying to handle the influx of people. Viola manages to get behind the bar and snoop around to find a key to the storeroom. She mostly finds a bag of gold, a locket, and many mugs and bottles of drink. In her attempt to sneak away, she runs invisibly into the young lad, who starts panicking and hyperventilating.

Screaming in terror, he runs out of the tavern, shouting about something he can't see. Idris, with the help of Thalen, calms the lad down and convinces him it was probably a ghost. Idris, as a mystic, offers to take care of it. Thalen drags the barkeep back to the tavern and pushes away a patron already grabbing free ale from the unmanned bar.

Idris manages to bring the young boy to an almost catatonic state by performing an actual seance, making the eyes on a skull he carries light up and speaking in a Xhorhasian accent. This draws the attention of everyone, who start excitedly gossiping. During the seance, Idris sees a scene play out in greyscale of the same tavern, with two patrons, a man and a woman, sitting at a table and getting into an escalating fight. The woman eventually draws a knife and stabs the man. An elfish woman behind the bar then draws a crossbow and shoots the knife-wielding patron, who falls down. As the woman dies, she makes eye contact with Idris and dies with a bloody grin on her face.

Idris tells everyone to hire him for other ghostly problems. Meanwhile, Ruby, still invisible, sneaks into and hides in the storeroom just as she becomes visible again. She finds barrels of ale, boxes of salted meats and bread, and a small chest containing sacks of different powders: white, black, orange, etc. Viola observes the patrons, but most are just enjoying the show while munching on sausages.

After the activity, Viola joins Idris outside without being noticed, and they stand in line for their own sausages, waiting for Nickolas and Abokar to return.

### The Fox's Fancy

Nickolas and Abokar enter The Fox's Fancy, confronted with a shop covered in sawdust and wood chippings. At the front of the shop is an excited half-elf named Lorianne Swiftglade, who ushers them inside to sell her wares.

Nickolas and Abokar come up with a plan to ask if she can make a walking cane with a carved bear that has a hidden compartment. Lorianne excitedly says she can and shows them drawings of her previous wood carvings. One of them is a bear, which she reveals was for a kind gentleman named Jasper who owns a local market cart that sells and buys exotic goods. She gives them the location of his cart.

After some more back and forth, Nickolas buys a wooden figurine of The Allhammer after she reveals a closet filled with carvings of all the pantheons in various shapes and sizes. She explains that these sell well. Everything is priced at just 2 silver. Lorianne reveals that it takes her almost the same time to make a small statue as it does to create a large one. When questioned about her documents for the wood, she gets flustered and digs deep into her chests to find an old parchment about the purchase of a large quantity of wood.

They also place a custom order for the same walking cane that Jasper uses, with the addition of a hollow interior that can be opened. This will take her a day or two to complete. They pay 2 silver up front and will pay 2 silver upon receiving the product.

### Spying on Jasper Quickfoot

Abokar and Nickolas find the cart and spy on it. They see a man dressed in a nicely tailored outfit with a big dark cloak lying beside him. Leaning against the cart is a cane with a bear carving. The man, assumed to be Jasper, is acting suspiciously and selling a small hand-sized crate covered with a cloth to a customer. The patron and he are leaning in close, whispering, nodding, and seemingly haggling over the price in a very suspicious manner.

Abokar and Nickolas follow the customer to his home and interrogate him in their capacity as a city watch sergeant and agent of the council, causing the man much distress. He sends his small family—consisting of a girl, a boy, and his wife—off to a side room when the girl complains about being hungry.

They convince the man they are investigating his purchase, so he shows them the small crate. Abokar immediately leans over the crate and listens to the man's confusion. He uncovers the crate to reveal a small pie covered in syrup and yellow pieces of fruit, which the man thinks is called *ango*. Nickolas corrects him, saying it's *mango* and that they sometimes contain insects, so they should inspect it by listening.

Abokar listens closely but hears nothing, so they take their leave to regroup with the rest.

### The Fat Pigeon

Both groups get together and share the information they found at both locations. Idris really wants a sausage, so they split up briefly again. Viola, Abokar, and Nickolas go to spy on Jasper at his cart, which is labeled *Jasper's Exotic Goods - Buying and Selling*. Idris and Ruby stay in line and buy five sausages while discussing their group and Idris's mystical abilities with Mr. Ironhand, who owns the sausage cart. They can tell he likes to talk a lot with his customers. They return to the group, bringing the sausages.

The group then starts their watch for the rest of the afternoon near Jasper's cart. Viola summons a fat city pigeon that sits on top of the cart, listening in on Jasper's transactions.

Jasper continues to act mysteriously and sells a man a Seashell of Whisperings for 2 gold, claiming it can let you hear the whisperings of your enemies. As they get closer, the voices become clearer. Jasper claims it's a very unique item. After the sale, he pulls out a new shell from a box and places it on his cart.

Viola's pigeon takes a closer look at the cart's contents and sees many knick-knacks, as well as some strongboxes that seem locked and of higher quality.

Ruby decides to approach Jasper and asks for *Yunfaalyu*, which confuses him. He tries repeating *Yushahshu*? When asked about anything from Wildemount, he pauses and then tries to sell the Map of Shifting Sands. Viola's fat pigeon lands on it, and Ruby uses this as an excuse to wave Jasper off, saying the map is worthless because a pigeon sat on it, then walks away.

Eventually, Jasper packs up his equipment and heads home. Viola shifts into a spider and hides under the cart, hitching a ride to his house. Ruby's flying squirrel tracks them and relays information to the rest of the group. Once home, Jasper makes a quick bite to eat and then sits at a table, measuring something onto parchment. Viola,

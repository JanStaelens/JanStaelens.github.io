## Quickfoot Caught Red-Handed

### Approaching the House

The group was informed by Viola that Jasper was currently occupied with something involving the drug Hum-Dust. Deciding to take immediate action, they split up. Nickolas and Ruby approached the front door, while Abokar and Idris went to the back. Viola slipped into the shadows.

Nickolas knocked on the front door, but when no one answered, Abokar began banging on the back door. When there was still no response, Abokar used a crowbar to break down the back door.

They found Jasper in the middle of the room, looking flustered and holding a small chest. Abokar ordered him to surrender. However, as Jasper pretended to comply, he quickly set down the chest, opened it, and pulled out a scroll. Jasper tried to intimidate Abokar, claiming it was a scroll of ultimate doom, and that Abokar and his thieving crew should leave his house!

Abokar called his bluff and rushed forward with his axe. Jasper, panicking, began reading the scroll, which to everyone's shock exploded into blood. Where the blood landed, it pooled together and burst into flames. Out of the fire, two demon Dretches emerged and began attacking.

### Into the Dark

Idris rushed in through the back door, and Nickolas abandoned the stubborn front door that wouldn't open, opting to climb through a window instead. The Dretches released a foul green smoke that poisoned everyone nearby.

Abokar, with his axe now aflame with blood, struck one of the demons, while Idris used his mystical powers to make one of the Dretches emit a truly hideous laughter, incapacitating it.

From outside, Viola enchanted several stones and threw one through the window, hitting Jasper on the head. Seeing how things were quickly going out of hand, Jasper waved his hands and cast Darkness, concealing his retreat upstairs.

Idris and Abokar continued battling the demons downstairs, while Nickolas chased Jasper through the darkness upstairs. Viola used special boots to run vertically up the walls and across the roof, while Ruby kept watch on the outside windows.

Ruby suddenly noticed Jasper peeking through one of the upstairs windows. She and Jasper had a quick magical duel, both flinging destructive spells at each other. Jasper attempted to retreat, but Viola managed to ricochet a stone that hit Jasper on the head again, causing him to curse loudly.

Jasper ran to another window just as Idris appeared upstairs, having finished off the demons downstairs with Abokar. Idris called upon the spirits to do his bidding, and with the ringing of breaking glass, the protective magic around Jasper shattered. He was left defenseless and cornered by Nickolas and Viola.

Viola and Nickolas intimidated him in their own ways, but Jasper got truly scared of Viola for some reason.

Facing overwhelming odds, Jasper began to de-escalate and tried to negotiate.

### The Truth and Nothing But the Truth

The group dragged a slightly battered Jasper to a chair downstairs and cuffed him in irons.

Idris searched through some chests in the attic and found several stacks of greasy parchment. Unable to resist, he licked some of the grease and briefly felt as if he saw himself opening a chest in front of him while still standing where he was, taking psychic damage from the experience.

Meanwhile, downstairs, Abokar began demanding answers from Jasper, roughing him up. Viola questioned Jasper to see if he realized the terrible consequences of selling the drugs.

Nickolas cast a Zone of Truth, which caused Jasper to speak only the truth, much to his confusion. This revealed that he got the scroll that summoned the demons from a friend named Balun, a dwarf with red scruffy hair and beard who travels with caravans and occasionally visits Kymal and the Shaded Alley with interesting stories and items.

During the interrogation, they discovered that several months ago, Jasper was approached by someone called The Alchemist in the Shaded Alley. The man looked like a 60-year-old human with short grey hair, no beard, and very sallow, sunken cheeks. Jasper met him only once in person. The Alchemist wanted Jasper to distribute Hum-Dust for him, as it’s very exotic and would sell well. Every two weeks, Jasper goes to a sewer grate under the large stairs near the big crane and mine entrance, where he leaves a bag of 50 silver and an empty greased-up Hum-Dust bag. An hour later, he returns to retrieve the full bag of Hum-Dust and his now-empty bag of silver, which he then sells.

### Dust, Dust Everywhere Around the City

Viola also managed to get Jasper to describe all the people and places where he had been selling Hum-Dust, though he didn’t know any of the people's names.

He described many people, but his most common customers seemed to be:

- An elderly man with a hunched back, a scruffy gray beard, and hair perpetually covered in a fine layer of coal dust. His clothes are tattered and patched, made from rough, durable materials that have seen better days. His face is lined with deep wrinkles. He is often found near "Iron Forge Alley," a narrow street lined with abandoned blacksmith shops.

- A middle-aged woman with stringy black hair, usually tied back with a rag. Her face is smudged with dirt, and her clothes are worn and threadbare, a mix of hand-me-downs and items scavenged from refuse piles. She can often be found at "Copper Vein Market," a bustling but rundown market district where the poorest gather to trade.

- A wiry, nervous-looking dwarf with a shock of unkempt brown hair and piercing green eyes. He wears an oversized coat with numerous pockets, all of which jingle faintly. His face is often covered in soot, making him blend in with the grimy cityscape. Frequently seen near "Silver Shaft Row," a district of crumbling tenements and abandoned mining shafts.

- A tough, muscular woman with short-cropped hair and a face marked by old scars and soot. Her clothes are heavily patched, and she wears thick boots caked with mud and grime. She spends her time in "Bronze Boulders," an area known for its derelict foundries and smithies.

- A gaunt woman in her late twenties, with hollow cheeks and dark, sunken eyes. Her hair is greasy and tangled, and she wears a mix of clothing that looks like it’s been pieced together from various finds. Her appearance is ghostly, and she haunts the "Quicksilver Quarters," a district near the outskirts of the city filled with the ruins of old mining equipment and deserted houses.

- A frail, elderly figure with a long, white beard and a hunched posture. His clothes are little more than rags, and he carries a well-worn walking stick. His hands are calloused, and his face is deeply lined. He is usually found at a small city park named "The Green Circle."

The group learned that Jasper was actually planning to go to the Alchemist's drop-off location this evening for a fresh supply of Hum-Dust. With about an hour left until the drop-off, the group must now decide how to handle the situation. They have uncovered all the details they could but are now left with an imminent drop-off and Jasper, who continues to try to strike a deal to let him go and continue his business, even without the Hum-Dust.

### The Loot

During this session, the group managed to find two stacks of special greased parchment in the attic, which Idris took with him. Ruby found and took two scrolls, one for "Enhance Ability" and one for "Silence," in the chest that Jasper was trying to escape with.

The chest also contained a single unidentified potion and two bags. One was a leather bag, also greased up, which held the Hum-Dust. The second bag appeared to be crafted from opulent velvet or brocade, feeling soft and smooth to the touch, with a deep emerald green color.

Viola discreetly checked Jasper and stealthily took an obsidian orb he was carrying, using the pretense of retrieving his dagger to cover this action.

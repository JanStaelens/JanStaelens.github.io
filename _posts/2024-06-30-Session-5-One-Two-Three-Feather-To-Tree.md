## One Two Three Feather to Tree

### Cut the Bullshit, We're Taking You In

As Jasper continued to try and bargain for his freedom, the group decided to drag him to the city barracks. Conveniently, the barracks were on the way to the hum dust drop-off point at the bottom of the large stairs and crane. With less than an hour until the drop-off, the clock was ticking.

Meanwhile, Viola split off from the group and tracked down a homeless man in a dark and grimy alley. What transpired there is currently unknown. The group wondered why Viola keeps disappearing or seeking time alone, but they had bigger fish to fry. They moved a shackled Jasper through the streets, passing the Maiden's Wish, and attracting attention. To avoid further notice, they took some unused side alleys.

Along the way, they investigated some items they had *cough* confiscated from the "crime scene." They found a very fancy bag that seemed to hold nothing but darkness. When they placed items inside and retrieved them, the items felt colder than when they went in. While playing around with the bag, they managed to retrieve a bag of 250 gold pieces. Jasper grew louder in his complaints until some creative use of a scroll of silence (jamming it in his mouth) quieted him down.

While traversing the lesser-traveled alleys, Abokar quickly realized they were being followed by three figures sticking to the shadows. He devised a cunning plan and decided to sneakily take a right while the rest of the group carried on.

### Kymal's Got a New Tree

Around this time, Idris asked the fancy bag for "keys" and retrieved a key that opened a small locked chest he had *cough* confiscated from Jasper's cart. Inside, he found a large ornate feather lying on a silk cushion. Enthusiastically, Idris began trying to write with it but noticed it didn't do anything. In a playful manner, he waved the feather in Ruby's face. On the third swish, the feather jumped out of his hands and instantly transformed into a massive 60-foot-high oak tree, its roots burying deep into the ground.

This massive tree partially blocked off the street between the group and Abokar and the three shady characters. The shock and distraction caused the shady followers to run past Abokar, complaining they'd lose them and needing to find a different route quickly.

### Not So Fast, Gentlemen

Abokar took this opportunity to confront the three men, lighting his axe on fire and intimidating them. In their shock, the central figure mentioned it was too soon for this. Refusing to say anything else, they tried to scatter. However, the group was prepared. Abokar blocked their way back, Idris climbed the tree and watched from above, and Nickolas prepared his magic to stop one in his tracks. One of the men managed to squeeze past Abokar with unexpected acrobatic feats, running down the road toward the busy market and casino central road of Kymal. Another tried to scale the roof, but Nickolas' magic froze him completely, allowing Abokar to bind him under Ruby's watchful eye. The third man scaled the building on the right and ran across the rooftops, but Idris swiftly followed and stabbed him deeply. In shock, he ran away to hide. Idris called upon spirits, holding a skull and whispering foul magic that found the hidden spy and caused him to bleed out and die.

### Quickfoot is Rather Quick of Foot

As the dust settled from the brief fight and chase, Nickolas and Ruby noticed that Jasper had managed to flee in the confusion. Nickolas attempted to track him down but concluded that Jasper had managed to weasel away.

Meanwhile, Abokar and Ruby interrogated the remaining spy, who turned out to be very frightened. He gave his name as Josh, though he initially tried to pass as Joshua. He revealed they were supposed to spy on the group until they gathered something—a special bag making 'noise'—and report back to someone named "The Bear" at the Wishing Well. He also mentioned sharing a room with his family there. Thalys, who knew the most, had been the one to run past Abokar.

Abokar decided to let Josh go with a warning, thoroughly scaring him. Josh became completely terrified when Idris jumped out of the tree holding the corpse of the third spy, whom Josh identified as Harold. Startled at being free, Josh stumbled away as fast as possible.

### Ominous Reports at the Barracks

After a scolding from Nickolas for killing the man, the group continued to the barracks. They were approached by guards who had been notified of someone carrying a dead person in the streets. Fortunately, one of the guards was an old friend of Abokar, Bruni Silvervein. After a quick discussion, Bruni asked Abokar to report to Huxley, but Abokar mentioned he was on a time limit for a secret investigation. Bruni agreed to process the body and keep it on ice in their dungeons.

Before they left, Bruni privately told Abokar that something strange was happening to some survivors from the ravager battle they were part of. Durnik and Gurni, who did mercenary work around Kymal, were now under the care of priests with strange wounds. The wounds appeared without any fight and healed mysteriously. Bruni asked Abokar to check in with Faragrim, another old crew member who became a blacksmith in Kymal.

### Scouting Out the Drop-Off

Viola, after her business, reached the hand-off location first. She hid behind bushes near a sewer grate built into the mountainside. Later, the rest of the group arrived, with Ruby scouting the area with her flying squirrel. Once clear, they hid in different locations. Idris perched high above, unknowingly close to Viola, who heard him muttering encouragement to himself. Abokar found a sturdy lock on the grate that could be opened from either side.

### Living Rock

Abokar, Nickolas, and Ruby hid some 60 feet away behind houses while Ruby kept watch on the grate. During their discussion, she noticed the grate unlock and open but saw nothing exit. Viola and Idris missed this due to shadows and wind. Ruby saw the bag disappear and warned the others. Viola saw the grate open again, suspecting someone had left. Ruby sent her squirrel into the grate, but it was killed.

The noise prompted Viola to rush to the grate and face a creature resembling living rock with glowing purple eyes and veins of purple and pink liquid. She swiped the lock, threw it away, and started running away, only to meet Abokar and Ruby sprinting toward the grate. They saw the creature heading deeper into a stairway and dark, wet tunnel.

### The Descent

The group decided to descend. Ruby, agitated, led the way without caring for stealth. Her pet's death perhaps fueling her desire for revenge. She cast her magic to illuminate the stairway and tunnel, which quickly turned into a natural cave system with glowing mushrooms and stalactites and stalagmites. Despite the rough terrain, Ruby rushed forward, followed closely by Idris. The rest of the group lagged behind as Ruby and Idris arrived at a dimly lit area with rotten wooden walls in front of them. She saw a dark pit with broken planks behind the wood. But more importantly she saw more light from beyond a heavy metal gate attached to the cave walls. She decided to climb the gat. As she climbed, she felt a sensation like a soap bubble bursting and saw two glowing purple eyes blink at her from the stone to her right. Idris arrived just in time to see a massive stone fist attempt to puch Ruby, who was just starting to climb.

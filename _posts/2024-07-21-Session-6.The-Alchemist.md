## The Alchemist

### When Mountains Start Moving

Entering the sewer grate, the group descended into a semi-natural cave system that ended with an iron gate. Ruby noticed she could try to climb it, but when she touched the gate, the wall next to her began to move.

It was revealed to be an alchemical golem, which punched Ruby and took a defensive position in front of the gate. Purple liquid flowed between the cracks of its runic-covered stone, resembling veins.

The party retreated to recover their wits, assisted by Ruby manipulating gravity to slow the creature. Viola called upon her powers and summoned a large black wolf, which appeared unhealthy at first.

The golem did not chase them but stood guard at the gate. The party heard someone beyond the gate awakening and packing up. They assumed the alchemist, who had been sleeping, was now aware of them and trying to escape.

With renewed vigor, the attack continued. Viola hurled magical rocks at the golem, and her wolf bit off pieces. Arrows were expertly aimed at its weak points, and axes cleaved deeply. In retaliation, the golem unleashed a toxic gas from its liquid veins but to no avail. Ruby danced around the creature, slashing until it crumbled into rubble. With newfound speed, Ruby jumped across the gap above the iron gate. Abokar used Betsy, his crowbar, to bend the lock and open the way to the next chamber.

### The Alchemist's Lab

The next chamber appeared to be a natural cave repurposed as a living area and laboratory. There was no sign of the alchemist, indicating the guardian successfully delayed attackers so he could escape.

Ruby and Nickolas did not give up easily. The group found an alternative exit via a small ladder leading to a large natural cave complex. Ruby rushed through the cave at extreme speeds, following the right-hand side, while Nickolas followed the left-hand side.

Meanwhile, Abokar guarded the main entrance to ensure the alchemist did not sneak past. Idris and Viola searched the room. Idris found a spider silk rope, which seemed strong but prone to unraveling. He also discovered a half-burned letter, which read:

```
Alistair,

Continue your work on diluting the Hum Dust and refining the formula to reduce fatalities. Use test subjects that won't attract attention. Stay hidden and maintain discretion at all times. Report your progress to the lighthouse within the month and we'll make sure your daughter is taken care of.

As usual, be on the lookout for other fragments. Return immediately if you encounter any such signs. 
Do not fail in this task.

***The rest of the letter is burned***
```

The letter included a symbol of concentric circles, unfamiliar to the group.

### Deep into the Mountain

Ruby and Nickolas continued their speedy run through the maze of tunnels in an attempt to catch up to the alchemist, navigating mostly by senses other than sight. Surprisingly, they ran into each other when Ruby circled back. Ruby cast her magic to illuminate the scene before they began attacking each other.

The rest of the group, including Viola carrying her wolf, reunited. Abokar and Viola focused on tracking, successfully following muddy prints through the tunnels.

The natural caves transitioned to mine shafts and man-made tunnels with wooden struts and mining cart rails. Tracking became more difficult, but the group deduced the alchemist was trying to escape outside. They followed the fresh air flow, moving upward until reaching a crosspoint with signs of a battle and drag marks leading to a partially collapsed mine shaft.

### Something Fell on Idris Again

In the dark mining tunnels, they squeezed through a collapsed section single file. Nickolas noticed some strange slime that numbed his fingers on contact. Viola's wolf froze in fear upon spotting something ahead. Abokar pushed forward and saw a long-abandoned storage room with bones scattered around. At the far end lay the body of a man, unmoving.

As the group entered and investigated, Viola shouted, "Don't forget to look up!" Idris looked up and saw the ceiling moving, signaling the massive Carrion Crawler to drop onto him and attack.

A battle ensued. Despite their exhaustion, the group used their last tricks to defeat the beast. Nickolas' magical words of encouragement healed and incited Abokar to attack faster. Viola expertly aimed enchanted rocks through the small gap in the collapsed tunnel.

Eventually, the beast lay slain, and the group investigated the corpse.

### Finding Pure Hum Dust

Idris took charge and cut open the clothing of the alchemist's corpse, discovering many precious items, including a beautiful glass flask containing brightly shining rainbow-colored dust. The flask exuded a constant hum, indicating they had found the pure Hum Dust.

The corpse had several other items: a ceramic jug with many stoppers, a healing potion, and a vial of murky white liquid. The man wore a simple gold band, which Idris took. Abokar carried the body, and the group followed the mine tracks to find the nearest exit.

### Exiting Above the City of Kymal

After a long journey through the damp mining tunnels, the group (minus the wolf) emerged at the top of a large stairway next to a massive crane. They breathed the clean air, overlooking the city of Kymal with its many lights mirroring the stars above. The distant sounds of the casinos echoed hauntingly.

The group decided to return to the alchemist's lab, with the grate entrance under the large stairs. Viola, needing a break, headed off alone. In this quiet moment, Nickolas noticed that Viola did not breathe unless speaking, a strange observation he kept to himself.

### Viola's Walk

Viola walked through the night shadows to The Shaded Alley, a place where one could find anything, legal or not. Upon arrival, she was recognized by Selena Nightshade, the tavern owner.

Viola confronted Selena, who revealed she knew Viola's name and companions but little else. Viola inquired about the best alchemists and potioneers. Initially, she was directed to Faelar Willowshade, a respectable elf potioneer near The Wishing Well casino. Pushing for more, Selena implied a price for further information. Viola stole a money purse from a customer and handed it to Selena, who laughed and warned her of more observant patrons.

Selena then directed Viola to Varis Nightbloom, a Tiefling renting Room 23 at the Gilded Lily Inn, for more exotic alchemical items.

### Forceful Identification

Meanwhile, the group reentered the alchemist's lab to identify their items. Abokar identified a potion of water breathing and a vial of Carrion Crawler mucus, though he was puzzled by his sudden knowledge.

Ruby found a beautiful white pearl, which she used in rituals to identify a ring as a Ring of Poison Resistance and the jug as an Alchemist's Jug.

Finally, the group gathered around the flask of Hum Dust. Ruby discovered the flask itself was magical, capable of temporarily dispelling magic. Strangely, the dust inside still hummed with magic.

Curious, Ruby used the lab's equipment to extract a spoonful of the dust. The surrounding air grew cerulean as a blue glow appeared around the dust. When Ruby cast Identification and touched the blue, a loud crack sounded, and an unknown magical effect entered her. Persistently, she continued to reach for the dust as more blue glow began to form.

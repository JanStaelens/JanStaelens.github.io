## What is Humdust

### Chaotic Investigation

Ruby continued experimenting with the mysterious substance known as Humdust. Her inquisitive nature led her to forcibly interact with the substance, resulting in a series of wild magic surges. The group witnessed a myriad of magical phenomena, including:

1. Ruby's sudden ability to spiderwalk.
2. The summoning of a Fog Cloud.
3. A bizarre moment where Ruby lost all her hair.
4. The triggering of a resurrection effect in case of death.
5. The unfortunate casting of a 5th-level Magic Missile on herself.

Despite the chaos, the group managed to glean crucial information about Humdust:

- The substance is identified as ground diamond dust.
- Ingesting Humdust induces vivid hallucinations and dreams, followed by confusion. Excessive consumption can transform the user into a magical nexus.
- When casting spells through the blue fog surrounding Humdust, the spell's effects are doubled, but at the cost of triggering two wild magic surges.
- The device used to create Humdust can be recognized or constructed by Ruby now. The process involves infusing diamond dust with energy from an object roughly the size of a fist.

Ruby's reckless experimentation eventually caused her to lose consciousness. Fortunately, the group was able to stabilize her and heal the injuries sustained during the magical surges.

### Cleaning Up the Mess

After taking a short rest outside, the group faced the challenge of safely handling the remaining Humdust. They deliberated over the best course of action and ultimately decided to return the dust to its container and use Dispel Magic to neutralize its effects.

Abokar bravely approached the blue glow once more to return the spoonful of dust to the bottle. However, this interaction caused him to experience a brief moment of terror, during which he became irrationally frightened of Idris.

### The Abduction of Rono Clay

Meanwhile, Viola arrived at a bustling tavern where city guards were taking inventory and filing a report about a fight and abduction earlier that morning. The victim, an older man identified as Rono Clay, had been defending himself with a pistol before being overpowered and taken away by a group of hooded figures.

Lisa, who had sustained a black eye during the altercation, recounted the event to the guards while Viola listened intently. She described how the hooded individuals had engaged in a fierce struggle with Rono before knocking him unconscious and abducting him.

The guards, along with Lisa, managed to clean up most of the damage, though several walls were riddled with bullet holes, and one window had been hastily boarded up.

Viola eventually reunited with Nickolas, and the two of them retired to their respective rooms, reflecting on the troubling events that had unfolded.

### A Spicy Room

Ruby and Idris decided to indulge in a luxurious stay at the Golden Hearth Inn. Their chosen room was an opulent suite, complete with a cozy bed adorned with heart-shaped pillows and mirrors covering every surface, including the ceiling. The atmosphere was one of decadent comfort. The room was clearly intended for more... active nights.

### A Very Quick Gamble

The following morning, Viola ventured out to test her luck with a single gold coin, hoping to turn it into a hundred. She briefly entered the Dragon's Hoard casino but left quickly when they insisted she check her walking stick as a weapon. She then moved on to the Maiden's Wish that did not require checking-in weaponry, where she exchanged her gold for chips and attempted a few simple casino games.

Unfortunately, her luck was not on her side, and she lost all her money. Disheartened, she rejoined the group, contemplating the risks and rewards of gambling.

### Ambush with Guns

The group found themselves embroiled in a heated debate about what to do with the remaining Humdust. While their word had been given to deliver it to Lord Greystone, some members of the group expressed concerns about the potential dangers of entrusting such a volatile substance to him. They also recognized its significant monetary value, further complicating the decision.

As their argument grew louder in the open square, they were suddenly ambushed by gunfire. Four shots rang out, and bullets struck the ground around Nickolas, wounding him. Viola reacted instinctively, her scream transforming into a bear-like roar as she scaled the wall of the tallest building and charged toward two of the shooters.

Nickolas quickly cast a charm spell on the two assailants near Viola, causing them to drop their weapons, which fell to the ground below. Meanwhile, the two shooters on the opposite rooftop fired another round at Nickolas, but their shots missed. They then ducked behind cover, attempting to conceal themselves.

Realizing that Nickolas was the primary target, Idris used his magic to render him invisible, providing some measure of protection from the ongoing assault.

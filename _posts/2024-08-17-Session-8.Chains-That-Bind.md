## Chains That Bind

### Bullets are flying

As the dust from the first few seconds of battle begins to settle, two of the ambushers have disappeared onto the rooftops while the other two are engaged in combat with a giant bear. Nickolas, now visible and no longer under fire, scrambles up the side of a building, eager to distract one of the attackers and assist the strange viola-playing bear. Meanwhile, Idris concentrates on keeping Nickolas invisible while deftly loosing arrows at the attackers. Ruby, moving with incredible speed, ascends a building with graceful efficiency, her blade gleaming as she confronts one of the ambushers.

Abokar, feeling the surge of battle in his veins, races forward. His blood heats as he climbs towards the two mercenaries who are relentlessly stabbing at Viola in her bear form. A cut on his hand makes him feel his heartbeat throb through the wound as his blade ignites with flame.

The mercenaries seem focused entirely on their pistols and daggers, attacking the bear and Viola until she collapses. Fortunately, Nickolas is nearby to heal her while Abokar ensures she isn’t taken down again.

Idris climbs a tree.

Meanwhile, Ruby, leaping between rooftops, chases one of the mercenaries. With a burst of magic, she pushes him off the roof to a long drop below, his body crashing onto the cobblestones, lifeless.

### Things are heating up

Suddenly, Abokar is no longer in the town square—he’s transported back to a battlefield many years ago. He’s surrounded by ravagers, orcs, and goblins. His vision flickers between past and present, his body radiating more and more heat until the ground beneath him begins to char.

As Viola retreats to recover, Abokar cleaves through the mercenary. To him, however, it’s a goblin. He hears the splintering of wood, smells the iron tang of blood, feels the sting of it in his eyes. He’s fighting in two places at once. As he advances on the last mercenary, a sudden spike of pain stabs through him. Looking down, he sees a goblin's spear piercing his stomach. The pain feels real, and the wound is there, visible. Ruby passes by, jokingly asking if he ate something wrong, seeing him clutch his stomach, though no visible attack had hit him.

### Idris falls

Idris falls out of a tree.

### Idris falls again

Idris sprints across a square dominated by a lion statue, shooting arrows at the last mercenary as he leaps across open ground. Two loud bangs ring out. Idris goes down with a meow of pain. Ruby, moving at blinding speed, closes in on the mercenary and engages in a brutal, almost dance-like battle. Crossbow bolts zip through the air, fired by Abokar, now partially collapsed on a rooftop. He begins shouting for a medic, yelling that Durnik has fallen!

Viola, having regained some of her strength, rushes back to the square, witnessing Idris being shot and rolling across the ground. She reaches him just in time to heal him back to life.

### Visions between life and death

As Idris awakens, he watches Abokar use a lamppost to descend from the rooftop. Everywhere Abokar steps, the ground is scorched, the air around him shimmering with heat. For a fleeting moment, Idris glimpses into the spirit realm, chains descending from the sky to wrap around Abokar. Blinking, the vision vanishes.

Meanwhile, Abokar finds himself back in a familiar nightmare. He’s chained to a bed, tubes pumping red, blood-like liquid into his body. He panics, using his strength to break free of the chains and pull out the tubes. Hands reach out to hold him down; distant voices shout as if underwater. "He's awake!" "Hold him down!" His vision begins to fade, but just before losing consciousness, he notices a sigil on one of the captors' sleeves—a dagger pointing downward, surrounded by a drop of blood. The last thing he hears is, "Damn, I think this one failed."

### Making trauma disappear

As the last mercenary attempts to flee from Ruby, he drops from the roof and makes a desperate dash to escape. But he’s chased by everyone except Nickolas and Viola. Viola, meanwhile, has returned to the rooftop where Nickolas has stabilized the two mercenaries left for dead by Abokar. She cradles one of their heads and sees into his dreams—visions of newly gained riches, roasted boar, and laughter with his comrades as they plan to delay a certain group from reaching Greystone Manor.

Nickolas watches silently, quietly manacling the unconscious mercenaries.

### The dust falls, the chains tighten

Idris releases an arrow that strikes true, hitting the last mercenary in the back of the head, ending the battle. But Abokar, lost in his vision, continues fighting unseen enemies, shouting about protecting Helga and Dunkirk. The heat around him intensifies, his heartbeat thundering in his ears. Idris watches in horror as he begins to hear the same heartbeat, echoing from deep within the spirit realm. It grows faster and faster until, abruptly, it stops. The world turns gray, time freezing. Abokar drops to the ground, thick metal chains wrapping around him. The chains stretch far into the sky, where an enormous female figure grins down at him. She notices Idris watching and grins wider, locking eyes with him. Her mouth opens as if to speak.

Meanwhile, Abokar is trapped in an endless loop. He wakes on the bed, pulls out the tubes, hears the same voices again and again. This nightmare repeats, over and over. Then, both Idris and Abokar hear a female voice reverberating through their minds:

“Three years of stolen breath are gone,  
Your borrowed life now wanes,  
The shadow’s grip begins to dawn,  
And death for you remains.  

The soul you pledged, the devil’s due,  
Now teeters on the brink,  
Unless three lives, near death like you,  
From fate’s dark edge you drink.  

Through alchemy’s ancient blood-bound rite,  
Their dying breath sustain,  
And in their lives your soul’s new light,  
Shall break the devil’s chain.”

### The guards arrive

Time resumes. Only Idris and Abokar are aware of what just happened, but the entire group feels a surge of power, as if they’ve brushed against a well of infinite energy. Ruby shakes off the sensation and climbs back up to the rooftops, finding Viola cradling the second mercenary’s head. Ruby pokes her awake, and Viola calmly explains she was merely erasing any “traumatic experiences” the mercenaries might have suffered.

Abokar stands, no longer burning but feeling a tightness in his chest, like the stress before an important exam. He pulls out his alchemy jug, asks for wine, and sits down on a bench to drink. Idris joins him, asking what just happened, who that woman was, and insisting that Abokar must *not* follow the instructions from the riddle.

Exhausted, Abokar recounts his visions—the battlefield, the sigil on the sleeve, the tubes, the voices, and the strange battle against what felt like hundreds of goblins.

As the conversation winds down, a group of guards arrives in the square. One grizzled veteran steps forward, demanding an explanation. Viola launches into a rapid explanation, and the guard slowly raises his eyebrow as he listens.

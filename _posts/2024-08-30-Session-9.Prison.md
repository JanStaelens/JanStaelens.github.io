## Session 9: Prison

### The Return of Rono

As the guards surrounded our adventurers, Viola tried to explain everything, her words pouring out in a frantic stream. Before the grizzled veteran guard could interrupt, the sound of heavy footsteps and gunshots echoed through the square. Five more hooded figures appeared, opening fire, mostly targeting Nickolas.

The guards dove for cover as the veteran fired his crossbow. Viola, in a panic, jumped on Nickolas to protect him and turned him invisible. Before anyone else could react, two of the hooded men were taken out by a disheveled and battered Rono, who had appeared on a rooftop above them.

Nickolas broke free from Viola and took cover behind a large lion statue in the center of the square. Before he could shout anything, Ruby stepped forward and unleashed a devastating Gravity Spell. The spell obliterated the remaining three attackers, shattering the road, cracking the surrounding buildings, and creating a bloody explosion that painted the streets—and Rono—completely red.

A long pause followed as everyone tried to process the sudden and brutal end to the fight.

### The Guards’ Ultimatum

The loud and destructive display left the guards with no choice but to arrest the group. Despite their attempts to explain they were victims, something in Idris's words turned the guards against them. The adventurers were shackled and led through the main road of Kymal, attracting curious and gossiping onlookers.

As they were being led away, the veteran guard ordered Jenkins to collect the two original ambushers, showing little concern for the group’s warnings about leaving the mercenaries on the roof.

### Processed and Locked Up

At the barracks, the group was taken deep into the dungeons of Kymal. They were stripped of all their items, jewelry, and weapons, which were placed in the Evidence Room. Ruby managed to hide a small pendant, but Idris’s attempt to cast a spell was quickly stopped by the wary guards, knocking him out. Abokar’s protests were met with firm resistance, and despite their objections, the entire group was locked up.

Abokar demanded to speak to Captain Huxley, but the guards told him to be quiet, saying Huxley wouldn’t be back until tomorrow.

Left in the cold, damp dungeon, the only sounds were the drip of water and the faint rustle of cots.

### Rono’s Story

As some of the group rested, Rono began to explain his absence. After a fierce fight at the Muddy Boot Inn, he had been kidnapped and forced to work non-stop in a tinker shop, crafting weapons for an unknown group. Exhausted and desperate, he secretly made a pistol and an explosive. When most of his captors left, he struck, killing a lone guard and escaping. While finding his way through the city, he heard distant gunfire and rushed to the Lion Statue Square, arriving just in time to intervene.

### The Corrupt Patrol

Every hour, two guards, later identified as Jules and Cesar, patrolled past the cells, gossiping about random topics. One whispered to the other about a “humming bottle” in the Evidence Room, something they believed The Clasp would pay handsomely for. Realizing the potential danger of losing the Hum Dust, the group had a fierce debate, convincing Nickolas that staying in the cell could cost them everything, even if an escape would be illegal.

### Viola Embraces the Rat

Viola hatched a plan to check the Evidence Room. Using her abilities, she transformed into a rat and scurried toward the open door during the guards’ patrol. Unfortunately, they noticed the rat and were about to kill it until the group in the cell distracted them with loud shouting. Viola seized the opportunity to slip into the Evidence Room.

Inside, she found a complex Arcane and Mechanical Lock guarding their items. The guards had managed to open two of the five locks by trying different combinations. In an attempt to sabotage the lock, Viola accidentally triggered a poisoned needle trap, causing her to drop her form.

### A Close Call

Hearing the metal door rattle, Viola quickly changed back into a rat. The guards shot at her but missed as she scurried across the ceiling and walls, eventually slipping back into the cell. The guards, frustrated, decided to leave the “rat” among the prisoners.

Viola returned to the group and shared everything she had learned.

### Spooking the Guards into Chaos

During the next patrol, Idris seized the moment to confront the guards, threatening to report their corrupt behavior to the captain. With the group’s help, he revealed details only someone who had been in the Evidence Room could know, including the progress they had made on the locks. He claimed he had the spirits on his side. Intimidated, the guards offered to release them in exchange for their silence, but the group instead demanded that the guards lock themselves in the cell with them.

Idris and Ruby, not trusting the situation, decided to guard the Evidence Room themselves. As night fell, they all eventually drifted off to sleep, only to be rudely awakened by the changing of the guards, who immediately called for reinforcements and put everyone back into their cells. Jules and Cesar tried to convince the new guards that they were the victims, but no one believed them. Jules and Cesar were taken in shackled with the guards.

After the chaos, the group finally managed to get some rest, though Abokar’s nightmares left him waking with a shout.

### Huxley Arrives

In the morning, Captain Huxley arrived and ordered a chair brought down to the cell. He listened as Abokar debriefed him on the events, including the Hum Dust and the group’s recent actions. Huxley pondered their story before deciding to accompany them to Lord Greystone, as they had been acting on his behalf. He hoped to convince Greystone not to use the dangerous Hum Dust and suggested using his alchemical skills to further investigate the substance.

Huxley also requested the note left by Alistair, The Alchemist, which spoke of a group holding his daughter hostage and mentioned needing to report back to "The Lighthouse." Though there is no lighthouse near Kymal, the group speculated it might refer to the temple at the center of town, though Huxley remained unconvinced.

With the promise to look into the note, Huxley returned the group’s gear and began escorting them to Greystone Manor.

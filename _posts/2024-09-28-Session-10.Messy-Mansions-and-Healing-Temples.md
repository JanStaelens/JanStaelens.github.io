## Session 10: Messy Mansions and Healing Temples

### Heading to the Mansion

Huxley accompanied the group back to the manor of Lord Halen Greystone. On the way, he explained that he’d leave most of the talking to the group, as they had firsthand experience with the events. They kept a close watch for anyone following them but only saw a few old ladies gossiping about them. Viola, annoyed, approached the women, scaring them off.

### Meeting Greystone in His Lab

The group was let in by Boris, the butler, who led them to Lord Greystone’s lab. Greystone was busy with bubbling liquids and alchemical equipment, making pigments. The lab was chaotic, with colors splattered everywhere and pots of strange ingredients scattered about. 

The group, along with Huxley, explained the dangers of Hum Dust and how they had been under attack almost since the moment they left on their quest. They suspected someone in Greystone’s household might be responsible for a leak.

### Interrogation of Lia

Lia was called in for questioning. She swore she hadn’t spoken to anyone about the group, except when asking where to buy some of the drugs when she goes to party near the Muddy Boot Inn. She couldn’t remember mentioning the group specifically. When asked about Mila, they were told Mila was sick in her room and hadn’t left all day. Nickolas and Rono decided to follow Boris to check on her.

### Mila's Room

Nickolas hesitated to enter after hearing a faint, sickly voice telling them she just needed rest. Rono, however, insisted they go in. Inside, they found Mila lying weakly on the bed. She was struggling to breathe and looked far older than her 53 years. When they first met her, Mila looked 18, thanks to a special cream called "EternaYouth." Now, she appeared to be 90 or even older. Rono picked her up and carried her to the rest of the group.

### A Rush to the Temple of the Lady of Luck

Seeing Mila’s condition, the group decided to rush her to the Temple of the Lady of Luck for healing. Not everyone went. Lord Greystone, Boris, Rono, and Nickolas took Mila in a carriage. Huxley and Abokar followed in a cart they commandeered. Viola, Idris, and Ruby stayed behind at the mansion with Lia.

### Healing Mila

At the temple, a brother greeted them and guided them to a basement filled with nurses and cots. The head cleric, Brother Eldon, was called. Recognizing Lord Greystone, he quickly grasped his holy symbol and cast Greater Restoration on Mila. Though she remained old, her health improved enough for her to sit up and talk.

Mila explained she had been using EternaYouth for years without issue. That morning, however, her usual dose didn’t work, so she applied more. When it started making her older, she panicked and used a third dose, which left her in this state. The cream cost her 1,500 gold pieces, a fortune she had saved for years. With Brother Eldon’s reassurance, she applied another dose and became young again. Abokar was able to secure a sample of the cream, promising a discount for Mila if he found an alchemist who could replicate it.

### Abokar Talks with Faragrim

While Nickolas helped heal others at the temple, Huxley noticed a man on one of the cots who hadn’t left. Abokar recognized him as Faragrim, a fellow soldier and survivor of the battle three years ago.

Faragrim confided in Abokar that he had been experiencing mysterious wounds that would appear, heal, and then reappear. It started a few days ago, and though painful, he tried to dismiss it. Abokar mentioned he had felt something similar recently, as if stabbed by an invisible spear. Faragrim had also heard that others from the Silvercut Crossroads battle, like Durnik and Gurni, had strange injuries. He asked Abokar to help investigate, not for himself, but for Durnik and Gurni. He also mentioned hearing rumors about the Ravagers becoming a threat again, with missing trade caravans near the Crossroads.

### Idris and Ruby Prepare the Lab

Back at the mansion, Ruby and Idris headed to the lab to investigate the Hum Dust. While Ruby performed a ritual to detect magic, Idris couldn’t resist touching everything. He eventually created a colorful, knotted cloth in one of the devices but ended up making a mess when the paint spilled everywhere. Ruby, meanwhile, entered a storeroom full of ingredients, sensing something magical, but it wasn’t visible inside the room.

### Ruby Finds a Notebook

While searching the lab, Ruby found a notebook detailing various experiments with different ingredients, noting their reactions when heated, cooled, or distilled. She quickly found notes on Hum Dust, with repeated attempts to purify it, all ending with the word “brown” written in an increasingly frustrated tone.

### Idris' Storeroom Disaster

Idris eventually entered the storeroom Ruby had briefly explored and was drawn to a shiny bottle on a high shelf. When he climbed up to reach it, the entire cabinet fell over, sending ingredients and bottles crashing to the floor. In a panic, Idris attempted to turn the mess into a floor painting, but most of the colors turned brown, except for a small, angelic figure he painted.

### Viola and Lia

Meanwhile, Viola stayed with Lia in the kitchen. Lia shared more about her habits with Mila and mentioned that Lord Greystone was actual friends with Arnoud. They met at a play Arnoud had written and quickly became close, though Lia didn’t know what they worked on together. 

Suddenly, a loud crash upstairs startled them. Lia pulled out a dagger, ready for anything. Viola transformed into a wolf and ran upstairs, fearing an ambush. She startled Ruby, who was trying to break into Lord Greystone’s office. Ruby cast a shadow blade, accidentally hitting Viola, causing them both to scream in shock and Viola to drop her wolf form.

### Idris Caught Red, Green, and Purple-Handed

Viola, returned to wolf form, rushed with Lia to the storeroom where the loud noise came from. There they found Idris proudly showing off his "art," surrounded by shattered bottles and spilled ingredients. The mess was enormous. Lia fainted at the sight of it. When she awoke, now covered in paint, Idris began magically cleaning her while Viola calmed her down.

### Ruby Breaks In

Meanwhile, Ruby had managed to unlock the door to Lord Greystone’s office. She tracked the magical presence to something hidden behind a wall or bookcase, but couldn’t figure out how to access it. Eventually, she sat down at Greystone’s desk, fiddling with everything she could find.

## **Session 11: The Magic Unravels**

#### **Ruby's Encounter with Fear**

Ruby, ever the daring adventurer, had broken into the office of Lord Halen Greystone, determined to uncover the magical signature hidden behind the bookcase. She began her search methodically, sitting in Lord Greystone’s chair, fiddling with various objects, hoping to discover a secret switch. Frustrated, she decided to pull each book from the shelves. When her hand reached a small, black, untitled book, everything changed.

A magical trap was triggered, and it invaded her mind. Ruby suddenly found herself gripped by fear, convinced that soldiers of the Dynasty were outside the office searching for her. In her panic, she hid behind a sofa, consumed with thoughts of escaping.

#### **Abokar’s Inquiry at the Temple**

Meanwhile, Abokar was at the temple, speaking with the monks after Mila had been healed by Brother Eldon. Having finished his conversation with Faragrim, he turned to an elderly monk to ask if this temple had ever been referred to as "The Lighthouse." The monk, puzzled, informed Abokar that he had never heard the temple of the Lady of Luck described that way.

As the day progressed, Rono, Boris the butler, and Halen Greystone returned to the mansion, while Huxley, Nickolas, and Abokar followed shortly afterward.

#### **Idris Cleans the Lab**

In another part of the estate, Idris was busy cleaning up the chaos he had caused in the lab and storeroom. Despite the damage, he managed to restore the area to an even cleaner state than before. Viola had escorted Lia, the maid, back downstairs and heard Halen’s return. Preparing for the inevitable confrontation, she went outside to warn him. 

There was a brief moment of confusion when Boris revealed the massive two-handed axe strapped to his back, but to everyone’s relief, there was no need for a fight. 

Halen found Idris just as he finished cleaning and, though he appreciated the effort, he informed Idris that the 100 gold piece reward would be withheld to cover the cost of repairing the damage.

#### **Ruby’s Flight and Return**

Curiosity piqued, Halen asked about Ruby. Noticing his office door had been forced open, he opened it only to see Ruby, terrified, dart past him and Boris. Boris attempted to grab her but missed, tackling Halen to the ground instead. Ruby ran out of the front door, shouting about the Dynasty, with Idris sprinting after her on all fours, and a winded Rono not far behind.

Viola, sensing the danger, took cover in a nearby alley while Idris and Rono ran into Abokar, Huxley, and Nickolas. After explaining the situation, the group searched for Ruby but eventually returned to the mansion empty-handed.

#### **The Hum Dust Experiment**

Ruby eventually returned, and the group gathered in Halen’s lab. Though no charges were pressed, both Ruby and Idris lost their promised reward. The party shifted focus back to their experiment involving the mysterious "Hum Dust."

Viola meticulously recorded Halen’s findings, while Nickolas prevented Idris from causing distractions. Ruby lent her arcane knowledge, and Halen guided the team. Together, they discovered that the Hum Dust seemed to be part of a new, chaotic school of magic that "unraveled" things, breaking them down.

#### **Securing the Hum Dust**

With their findings in hand, the group discussed the dangers of keeping the Hum Dust. Halen expressed his reluctance to store it, given how dangerous and useless it was to him. After much deliberation, they decided to hide the real Hum Dust and perhaps create a decoy.

They painted the container black to conceal it, and Ruby took responsibility for keeping it safe.

#### **Viola Learns the Truth**

Later, Halen pulled Viola aside to share something profound. Arnoud, a dear friend who had passed away from old age, had asked Halen to reveal certain truths to her after his death. Lord Greystone explained that Arnoud had spent his final years researching magical disturbances and curses that plagued specific families and groups. Viola, along with the others, had been gathered for more than just one purpose—partly for the mystery of the Hum Dust, but also for another, deeper reason.

Halen had taken notice of Ruby’s arcane abilities, Idris’ recent arrival from Xhorhas, and Abokar’s connection to the Ravagers. He also suspected that Rono’s ties to Whitestone and Nickolas' connections to the university in Emon could prove valuable. Halen believed fate had drawn them all together. Disturbing similarities in magical phenomena were occurring in Xhorhas, Syngorn, and among the Ravagers—chaos that seemed intertwined with madness and magic.

Halen confessed that he had brought this group together with the hope that they might help Viola, should she choose to continue Arnoud’s research.

Viola took the revelation with quiet frustration, struggling to understand why Arnoud had spent his final years so consumed by this research instead of enjoying life. Halen reassured her that Arnoud had found joy in his work, and though he had passed away, he had entrusted her with the knowledge he had accumulated. Halen emphasized that he had no expectations, only that he had fulfilled Arnoud’s final request by sharing the truth with her.

#### **Viola's Grief and Healing**

Overcome with emotion, Viola left the mansion, retrieving her gold before heading to Arnoud’s home. There, she unleashed her grief, destroying much of the furniture in a fit of rage. But soon, sadness overtook her, and she set out to repair the damage she had done. 

While walking through town, she noticed children playing with a doll, and in a brief, cathartic moment, she grabbed the doll and handed it to one of the children, before they ran off, laughing and playing again. 

Viola managed to fix most of the damage she had caused, though a small pile of broken furniture remained untouched.

#### **Abokar Seeks Help**

While Viola was with Halen, Abokar shared his personal struggles with the group. He explained that something strange had happened to him and his dwarven brothers during the war, and now he sought answers. Huxley, overhearing the conversation, mentioned that the city would fund a mercenary group to travel to the Silvercut Crossroads for 200 gold pieces each. Given the rising tensions with the Ravagers in the area, Abokar’s intent to travel there aligned with the city's needs.

The group agreed to help Abokar, each for their own reasons. Before leaving, Boris delivered a private message from Viola to Idris, encouraging him to never lose his curiosity. Boris, unsure of the message’s full meaning, simply relayed it as given.

#### **An Unraveled Evening**

As the session drew to a close, Viola sat in the quiet house of Arnoud, waiting for darkness to fall. Meanwhile, Abokar and Ruby headed to Abokar’s house as the streets grew darker. Rono and Idris, in search of excitement, decided to try their luck at the Maiden's Wish casino, despite Huxley’s nervous suggestion to pick a different establishment.

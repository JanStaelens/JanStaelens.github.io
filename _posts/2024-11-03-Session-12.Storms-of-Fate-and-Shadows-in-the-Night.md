## **Session 12: Storms of Fate and Shadows in the Night**

### **Night has begun, and the group is split**

A massive thunderstorm rolls over the mountains west of Kymal, casting the city in sheets of rain and deep, booming thunder. The casino district bustles with new patrons seeking refuge and excitement amidst the storm. Among them are Idris and Rono, who head to the Maiden’s Wish Casino, eager to finally experience the allure of Kymal’s grandest establishment after an intense few days.

Meanwhile, Viola, emotionally drained from a difficult conversation about her servant Arnoud, retreats to her home. Feeling a gnawing hunger, she takes her newly acquired gold and heads to the Ladies of Pleasure. Ruby and Abokar retire to Abokar's home to spend the evening discussing their pasts. Nickolas returns to The Muddy Boot Inn, where he drafts letters to Emon and the Tal’Dorei Council, voicing concerns over the corruption and actions of the town guards.

### **Viola’s Night**

Through the pouring rain, Viola enters an establishment where the sounds of pleasure mingle with the heavy scents of perfume and incense. She hands over two gold pieces to the matron and is shown to a room with two companions for the night. Viola surprises them by giving each an additional gold piece with a peculiar request: she wishes for them to remain silent and roleplay as if she were a mother soothing them to sleep. Although confused, the two women agree, and as the thunder crashes outside, they eventually fall asleep. Viola is left alone to do as she pleases until her own contentment is reached.

### **Idris and Rono at the Casino**

Idris stops by Viola's home in Kymal, but finding no one there, he and Rono brave the storm to reach the opulent Maiden’s Wish Casino. The warmth, the music, and the lively crowd immediately envelop them as they exchange 10 gold each for special casino chips embossed with "The Maiden’s Wish" and the symbol of the Lady of Luck. The crowd quickly separates the two, each embarking on his own adventure.

Idris takes in the vibrant atmosphere, noting the variety of games, the central bar, and the guards positioned strategically around the room. Near the bar, a cluster of important-looking figures gathers around an unknown individual. Idris decides to reach out to the spirits and, seated at a large table, discreetly performs a ritual with a skull in his lap. His vision reveals a scene in the back rooms where a cheater is captured and killed—not by the guards, but by a separate, more ruthless militia under the casino owner’s orders.

As Idris comes out of his trance, he finds himself face-to-face with Calis Krishtan, the casino’s flamboyant owner, who witnessed the ritual and is thoroughly delighted. With grandiose gestures and a booming voice, Calis demands a larger spectacle for his guests. A table is cleared, and before Idris fully realizes it, he is pushed onto the tabletop with a growing crowd around him, waiting in eager anticipation.

Thinking quickly, Idris requests a volunteer, and Calis points to a guest at random. The man, terrified, is shoved onto the table by Calis’s bouncers, but he promptly faints. Growing impatient, Calis suggests one of his own bouncers, and the performance begins. Idris speeds up his movements, attempting a high-energy display, but the small tabletop limits his routine, giving it an awkward appearance. Still, he conjures fireworks and summons spirits to enter his volunteer, who stares blankly at first but finally collapses into hysterical laughter for a few moments.

Unfortunately, Calis is momentarily distracted, missing the climax of Idris’s act. When he turns back to see his unimpressed bouncer and a sweaty Idris, he is sorely disappointed. Calling Idris a charlatan, he has him thrown out of the casino, declaring he’d wasted a rare opportunity.

### **Theft at Abokar’s House**

As rain lashes against the windows, Ruby and Abokar shelter in his cozy basement, where an alchemical lab and smithy bear traces of blood from Abokar’s experiments. Abokar, after cleaning up, offers Ruby his bed and prepares to sleep on the floor, barricading the door with a cabinet as Ruby recounts her past. She reveals how her brother, Essek, jealous of her magical talents, framed her, leading to her banishment from the Kryn Dynasty. She further divulges a closely guarded secret—that the queen suffers from Typhros, a madness-inducing illness unknown to most. Ruby has been pursued across Exandria by the Aurora Watch ever since.

Later in the night, Abokar wakes suddenly, sensing something amiss. Pretending to sleep, he listens, and soon hears the faint creak of a nearby door. He bolts up and collides with something invisible, attempting to grapple it. A struggle ensues, and the intruder manages to slip out of a window, just as Abokar glimpses an outline in the rain. Rushing to the window, he finds no trace of the intruder, who vanished into the storm.

Ruby, alarmed, begins checking her possessions. To her horror, she discovers a vital bottle of hum dust—crucial and irreplaceable—has been stolen. Despite their exhaustion, they race through the mud-soaked streets to The Muddy Boot Inn.

### **Partial Regroup at The Muddy Boot Inn**

At the inn, Lisa admits Ruby and Abokar, who anxiously hurry upstairs to ensure Nickolas is safe. Though disturbed by the theft, they’re relieved to find him undisturbed. The list of those aware of the hum dust’s significance is short, and suspicion briefly falls on Idris until he arrives, soaking wet after his abrupt departure from the casino. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the group decides to visit Lord Halen Greystone’s manor without delay.

### **The Fight at Greystone Manor**

Arriving at the rain-soaked courtyard of Greystone Manor, Abokar hears rustling in a walled-off garden. Under the pretense of seeking privacy, he heads toward the noise. Moments later, he’s ambushed but swiftly turns to catch his assailant by surprise. The intruder attempts to flee, only to stumble straight into Ruby, Nickolas, and Idris, who use both magic and swift maneuvers to subdue him. Though restrained and bruised, the figure continues to struggle against their grip, hinting that the fight is far from over.

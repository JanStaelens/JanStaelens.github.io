## **Session 13: The Shape Shifter**

### **The Fight at Greystone Manor**

In the rain-slicked courtyard of Greystone Manor, thunder cracked, and lightning illuminated fleeting glimpses of the ongoing struggle. The group wrestled with a shadowy figure, slapping a pair of cuffs onto the thief’s wrists. But their foe was nimble, slipping free with practiced ease—only to be outmaneuvered by Nickolas, who quickly produced another set of manacles. The group redoubled their efforts and secured the thief once more.  

Seizing the opportunity, Ruby searched the thief and triumphantly recovered her stolen bottle of hum dust, confirming this was the same culprit from earlier that evening. The thief’s mask was removed, revealing a face as unfamiliar as it was untrustworthy.  

Their victory, however, was interrupted. From the sheets of rain and darkness emerged a commanding figure—Lord Greystone himself, his voice cutting through the chaos like a blade.  

### **Lord Greystone?**

Furious at the commotion outside his manor so late at night, Lord Greystone demanded an explanation. He ordered the group to remove the thief from his property but paused, eyeing the hum dust in Ruby’s possession. With an authoritative tone, he argued the dust was too dangerous for them to handle, insisting it be locked away safely within his mansion.  

The group hesitated, unease creeping into their ranks. Something felt wrong. His sudden change of heart was out of character, and the tension rose as accusations and arguments flew. Rono, his instincts sharp as ever, drew his weapon and leveled it at the lord.  

### **Boris Intervenes**

From the manor’s shadows, Boris, the ever-vigilant butler, emerged. Hearing the raised voices, he had sought out Mia, who confirmed Lord Greystone had been in his chambers not long ago. Realizing the deception, Boris stormed into the rain, wielding his massive two-handed axe. His fury was palpable as he confronted the impersonator.  

Despite the heated standoff, no one dared to strike first. The stalemate provided the thief with a moment of fortune. With astonishing skill, he slipped free of the cuffs and unleashed a sphere of magical darkness. Chaos erupted.  

### **A Chaotic Escape**

In the impenetrable blackness, the thief fled, evading their grasp despite a few lucky strikes that grazed him. As the darkness dissipated, the group’s attention snapped to another fleeing figure—Boris himself, sprinting through the streets.  

Realizing the impossibility of the situation, the group gave chase. The imposter, a shape-shifter, found its cunning outmatched by the group’s teamwork. With a combination of spells and sheer determination, they incapacitated the creature, leaving it laughing uncontrollably on the cobblestones.  

Meanwhile, the real Boris stood steadfast at the manor’s entrance, ensuring the group outside remained under scrutiny.  

### **The Shapeshifter’s True Form**

Surrounded and out of options, the creature abandoned its guise as Boris. Before their eyes, it shifted into the form of a crying seven-year-old girl. Its wails echoed through the rain-soaked streets, flickering lanterns coming alive in nearby windows as curious neighbors stirred.  

The transformation was unsettling, revealing glimpses of a strange, gray material beneath its skin during the shift. Abokar, unshaken by the theatrics, hoisted the creature onto his shoulder and carried it back to the manor.  

### **The Real Lord Greystone**

From a window above, the true Lord Greystone watched the scene unfold. With Boris’s urging and the group’s explanation, he retrieved an emergency scroll and summoned the captain of the guard. He offered the group sanctuary but ultimately agreed with Boris that it was safer for them to take shelter in the barn, away from the mansion proper.  

### **Interrogation and Rest**

Safe but weary, the group attempted to interrogate the creature, receiving only the pitiful cries of a frightened child in response. Frustrated, Abokar resorted to drastic measures, cutting off one of its fingers. The creature howled in pain before losing consciousness. The blood seemed disturbingly real, and the group was left questioning the nature of their captive.  

Drained from the long day, some members of the group seized the chance to rest while others kept watch.  

### **Huxley’s Arrival**

The arrival of Huxley, drenched and flanked by heavily armored guards, brought fresh tension. Though visibly exhausted, he listened as the group explained the child’s true nature. Among its possessions, they discovered Lia’s blade, stolen from the maid of the house, and a coin bearing the mark of The Clasp’s highest ranks.  

Ruby’s ritual confirmed the coin’s magical properties: a sending spell, usable once per day—a powerful artifact in the wrong hands.  

As the storm raged on, the group stood with their bound and unconscious prisoner, exhausted but resolute, bracing themselves for what the morning might bring.

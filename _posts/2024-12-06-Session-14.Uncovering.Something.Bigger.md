## **Session 14: Uncovering Something Bigger**

### **Moving the Prisoner**

The group gathered in the barn of Lord Greystone's estate, surrounded by horses and a carriage. They deliberated on how to transport the 'little girl,' a shape-shifting creature of unknown origin, to a safer location. The caves housing the alchemist's lab were deemed the best option. Boris took the reins of the carriage and drove the group to the site before returning the vehicle to maintain appearances. Meanwhile, Captain Huxley and his guards resolved to protect the mansion through the night.

### **A Challenging Stairway**

The storm raged on, and heavy rainfall turned the descent to the alchemist's lab into a treacherous ordeal. The group navigated a steep staircase cut into the cliffside, down from a sewer grate. Water cascaded into the darkness below, threatening to sweep away anyone who lost their footing. Ropes and teamwork proved vital as the group descended safely. Once inside, they searched the lab for signs of intrusion since their last visit.

### **A Creepy Night**

The group fortified the lab with makeshift traps and alarms. Abokar rigged a noisemaking device using ropes and his hammer, while Ruby crafted magical wards to sound alerts. Idris, in a stroke of creativity, placed the unconscious creature under a bench, reasoning that any sudden movement would alert them —and it did. During their watch, the creature stirred, hitting its head on the bench and alerting both guards.

What followed was unnerving. The creature stared at Abokar before morphing into his likeness, smirking and silent. It reverted to the form of a little girl but with a disturbingly wide smile and canine-like head movements that unsettled Idris, who promptly knocked it unconscious again.

The rest of the night passed uneventfully until the final watch, when the creature awoke once more.

### **Viola Pluntard**

Elsewhere in the city, Viola woke up in a house of pleasure, sharing the bed with two companions. Unbothered, she enjoyed a leisurely breakfast, observing and eavesdropping on the patrons. She caught whispers about the unexpected closure of the casino *The Wishing Well*, a first in over two decades. The gossip linked the closure to *The Clasp*, rumored to operate covertly through the casino.

Viola set out to leave the city, seeking a caravan for the journey. Initially, her fine attire deterred most mercenary groups, wary of the dangers posed by ravagers, orcs, and goblins. Demonstrating her ability to transform into a massive beast, Viola quickly gained their interest. She was invited to join a seasoned caravan heading north to Westruun. It would wait for her, until the evening.

### **The Truth and Nothing but the Truth**

Back in the lab, the creature had begun shifting into the likeness of each group member, mocking them with exaggerated impressions. Nickolas, determined to get answers, cast *Zone of Truth*. The magic momentarily revealed the creature’s true form: a long, gray, alien-like entity with unsettlingly dark purple eyes marked by concentric circles. It shifted quickly back into one of their forms, but the eyes remained purple with circles.

Bound by the spell, the creature taunted the group, speaking cryptically about forces far beyond their comprehension. It described them as "children playing on the shoreline of a great ocean," oblivious to the titanic battles raging beyond their view. It spoke of an anvil and a smith ready to reshape the world, blaming "Hum Dust" and its brother in Stilben for obstructing its mission.

When questioned about *The Clasp*, it mockingly transformed into the Margrave, Calis Krishtan, laughing boisterously. On the topic of lighthouses or the daughter mentioned in a note, it admitted ignorance. Its primary goal was to remove the "stupid dust" disrupting its work. When asked about its identity, it deflected, claiming it could be anyone.

The relentless mockery wore down Rono's patience. Enraged, he drew his weapon and shot the creature, killing it.

### **The Failsafe**

As the creature died, its form shifted into that of a little girl, sticking out its tongue in defiance before reverting to its true alien form. The group noticed a tattoo on its body: concentric purple circles filled with glowing runes and glyphs. Ruby identified the markings as part of a magical failsafe. The glyphs ignited, consuming the body to summon a chaotic beast.

The summoned entity defied nature, constantly shifting forms—growing heads, tentacles, and eyes, transforming into fire, ice, and sand in a surreal display. The group engaged in a fierce battle, enduring significant damage before finally defeating the creature. When it fell, it vanished entirely, leaving no trace except for the destruction it caused.

In the aftermath, the silence was deafening, an ominous reminder that the night’s horrors may only be the beginning of something much greater.

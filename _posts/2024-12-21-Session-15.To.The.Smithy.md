## **Session 15: To The Smithy**

### **The Aftermath in the Lab**

Abokar, Nickolas, Ruby, Idris, and Rono stood amidst the remnants of their recent battle, attempting to piece together the events that had transpired. The original creature had disintegrated, leaving behind only ashes, while its counterpart had vanished entirely.

Abokar expressed doubts about the entity's demise, puzzled by its nonchalant attitude toward its own end. Nickolas noted that, in his experience, cultists often exhibited similar behavior. Abokar countered, suggesting such actions typically serve a greater cause, leaving the unsettling question: How did this further its cause?

Ruby cast *Detect Magic*, revealing a dissipating cloud of conjuration magic. As the group took a brief respite, Abokar unexpectedly experienced an old wound reopening.

Resolving to proceed with their initial plan, they set their sights on the Silvercut Crossroads to investigate Abokar's situation and the Ravagers. Recognizing the need for provisions and information, they decided to head to the market.

### **Matters at the Manor**

Viola navigated the slick, rain-soaked streets to Lord Greystone's manor, the morning market bustling around her. Upon arrival, she overheard Boris, Greystone's butler, reprimanding a young messenger for failing to locate her. As Boris noticed Viola's approach, he dismissed the boy and retrieved the scroll himself.

Viola insisted on speaking with Lord Greystone. Boris explained that the manor had been attacked the previous night by a shape-shifting creature impersonating both Lord Greystone and himself. To verify her identity, he requested confidential information, but Viola curtly reminded him of the private note she had entrusted to him the day before. Satisfied, Boris led her to Lord Greystone, cautioning her to remain quiet as Huxley was resting.

Inside, Lord Greystone had converted the waiting room into a makeshift office. Upon seeing Viola, he gave her his full attention. Viola confronted him about meddling in her family's affairs, expressing her offense. Greystone clarified that he had been a close friend of Arnaud and had merely assisted with his research, providing resources and a secure location. He then handed Viola a bundle containing the entirety of the project and research, bound in leather.

Greystone emphasized that his involvement was solely to honor Arnaud's dying wish to inform Viola, the last known survivor. During their conversation, he expressed concern for her safety, noting the recent attack and the absence of Lia, who hadn't returned home. He also mentioned a group of adventurers who had departed with the shape-shifting creature and timidly requested Viola's assistance in ensuring everyone's well-being, offering payment for her efforts.

Viola stood, suggesting that any payment be considered 'hush money,' and warned Greystone against discussing the research with others, implying dire consequences. Unfazed, Greystone returned to his work as Viola departed, heading toward the grate leading to the secret lab.

### **An Awkward Reunion**

As Abokar, Nickolas, Ruby, Idris, and Rono made their way to the market, they spotted Viola ahead. They inquired about her whereabouts, with Idris mentioning a visit to her home that yielded no answers. Viola responded defensively, asserting that her personal life was her own concern and that her involvement with them had concluded with the completion of their previous job.

Abokar, suspicious, explained the recent attack involving a shape-shifting creature connected to a larger scheme. Listening intently, Viola eventually disclosed that she had spent the night elsewhere and had arranged to join a trade caravan heading north. While she intended to travel beyond the Silvercut Crossroads, she agreed to accompany the group for that portion of the journey. When pressed about her reasons for traveling further north, Viola remained guarded, redirecting the focus to the necessary preparations for their journey.

### **The Market**

The party navigated Kymal's bustling market, acquiring essential gear and supplies. Abokar sought books on alchemy but found only texts on cave mushrooms and poison concoctions, which didn't meet his needs. Ruby's search for magical literature yielded only fantasy and romance novels with tangential mentions of magic. Rono purchased one of these stories for leisure reading during downtime.

At the Fox's Fancy, Abokar collected a custom-made wooden cane with a bear-shaped handle, paying an additional two silver without hesitation.

Ruby and Rono entered the Fox's Fancy to escape another tense exchange between Viola and the group. The enthusiastic half-elven shopkeeper eagerly showcased her wooden sculptures. Ruby inquired about high-quality charcoal and a reputable place for metalwork. The shopkeeper provided an address and the name Faragrim. For the charcoal, she returned with a basket of low-grade pieces from her furnace. Mistaking the quality as superior, Ruby purchased it for two gold.

Rono, recognizing the deception, attempted to intimidate the shopkeeper into returning the gold. Unimpressed, she mistook his weapon for a metal sculpture and tried to sell him a similar wooden dragon carving. Distracted, Rono placed his gun on the counter to examine the statue, then left without paying to compensate for Ruby's loss.

Outside, Ruby questioned the whereabouts of Rono's pistol. Panicked, Rono rushed back inside to find the shopkeeper had picked up the firearm and accidentally discharged it, causing a loud bang and a hole in the wall. He quickly retrieved his pistol and exited.

The group, alerted by the noise, saw Rono emerge hastily before seeing the shopkeep quickly lock the door and turn a sign saying "closed".

### **Faragrim’s Smithy**

The group approached Faragrim’s smithy, greeted by the rhythmic clanging of metal on metal. Inside, a sturdy dwarf, shirt stained with blood and sweat, was immersed in his craft. Abokar recognized him instantly, and the two shared a warrior’s embrace—equal parts respect and camaraderie. Faragrim paused his work, wiped his brow, and turned his attention to the party.

“What can I do for you lot?” Faragrim asked, his voice like gravel warmed by a hearty fire.

The group quickly got to business, trading and bartering for equipment. Shields were exchanged, armor was fitted, and manacles—because every adventurer apparently needs a few—were purchased. Abokar eyed a set of splint armor, but Faragrim admitted he didn’t have it in stock. “Give me a few hours, and I’ll pull some strings. Might cost you a bit extra, though,” Faragrim offered with a knowing grin. Abokar agreed, rolling up his sleeves to help forge some special bullets for Rono while they waited.

Idris pitched in with the bellows, Abokar hammered out bullets, and Faragrim worked his connections to secure the splint armor. By early afternoon, the smithy was filled with the smell of sweat, metal, and the faintest whiff of dwarven pride. However, amidst the hard work, it became apparent that Faragrim was struggling.

Similar to Abokar, Faragrim was suffering from old war wounds mysteriously reopening and then miraculously healing again—but his condition was far worse. At one point, the strain and blood loss became very obvious, and Idris and Nickolas rushed to his aid, casting healing magic to help him. Without their intervention, Faragrim might have collapsed entirely from the relentless toll his body was taking.

Faragrim, grateful yet embarrassed, acted as if it wasn't as bad as it looks, worried what people might say about him otherwise. Despite his ordeal, he continued to forge ahead with the determination of a seasoned warrior.

Meanwhile, Ruby and Rono ventured to a nearby temple, where Ruby sweet-talked the priests into parting with a small brazier. Ruby performed a ceremony that left Rono’s jaw hanging. “Sir Cheeky,” Ruby’s flying squirrel familiar, reappeared, chittering cheerfully.

Nickolas and Viola, opting for a quieter afternoon, stayed near the smithy. Nickolas respected Viola’s guarded nature, keeping his focus on the street and indulging in a bit of people-watching. Viola, however, turned her attention to the leather-bound research bundle Greystone had given her. As she skimmed through the notes, her guarded expression shifted to one of growing concern.

The manuscript was a chilling tapestry of curses, madness, and corruption. It detailed the descent of her family from noble intentions to selfish ambitions, the ripple effects of their actions leaving destruction in their wake. The research also touched on cycles of madness tied to the Ravagers in Kymal and similar phenomena affecting the royal lines of the Krynn Dynasty. Pages of scratched-out notes detailed curses, diseases, and magical maladies, but it was the final page that caused Viola to pause.

Her name—along with the names of her companions—was listed, each tied to a section of the research. Abokar: linked to the Ravagers. Ruby and Idris: tied to Xhorhas and the Krynn. Rono: connected to Whitestone. Nickolas Adastra: his last name circled repeatedly, tied to a page on magical maladies and cursed artifacts. Halfway through, the handwriting shifted from Arnaud’s to Greystone’s—a detail Viola couldn’t ignore.

### **The Wishing Well**

The group reunited and Abokar proposed investigating the Wishing Well, a casino rumored to have ties to The Clasp. Upon arrival, they found it shuttered, the front door locked tight. Curious onlookers whispered among themselves, their gossip carrying tales of strange happenings within. A faint shout from inside piqued the group’s curiosity further.

After a quick scout of the perimeter, Idris grew impatient. With a dramatic flourish, he lobbed a rock through a window. Nickolas tried to assert some semblance of order, flashing his council badge in an attempt to disperse the crowd. Predictably, this had the opposite effect—because in Kymal, nothing draws a crowd like a bit of chaos.

The group clambered through the broken window, Abokar using his trusty crowbar, Betsy, to pry open an inner door. Inside, the casino was eerily quiet, save for the faint echoes of a heated argument emanating from somewhere below. They crept closer, catching snippets of a tense exchange:

“That thing was NOT Lia—it deceived us all!”

“We have to undo all the decisions she made, somehow.”

“How? Most of us are gone or in hiding! And what about those adventurers? They’re tangled up in this mess!”

The group exchanged glances, the weight of the unknown settling over them like a heavy fog.

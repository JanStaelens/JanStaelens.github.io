## **Session 17: Tracking Down a Bear**

### **The Flooded Sewers**

The storm had turned the sewers into a chaotic, rushing torrent, the echoes of water cascading through the tunnels making conversation difficult. Viola’s summoned flying spirit flitted ahead, its glow barely cutting through the oppressive darkness. They pressed forward, following the clearest set of muddy tracks they could find, leading them to a narrow, treacherous bridge slick with grime.

Ruby took the initiative, crossing first with deft precision, while Viola shifted into her giant spider form to ferry Abokar and Nickolas across. Idris, ever resourceful, dug his fingers into the cracks of the ancient stone, clawing his way across. The bridge held, but the tension in the air was palpable.

### **The Rot Grubs**

In a fetid corner of the tunnel, the group stumbled upon a grotesque tableau—a cluster of corpses fused to the wall, writhing with maggots. Viola, still in her spider form, cautiously shot a web at the mass. But as her silk struck the bodies, the maggots surged, spilling toward the group in a relentless tide.  

Abokar was the first target, but his resilience held. Viola wasn’t so fortunate. The grubs burrowed into her spider form, tearing through her body until her giant arachnid frame collapsed. Desperation took hold as she shifted into her bear form, only for the infestation to continue. The group scrambled to save her, using spells like *Turn Undead* and *Prestidigitation*, and even attempting crude surgery, but nothing seemed to work.  

As the grubs neared Viola’s vital organs, Ruby, Idris, and Abokar realized they were fighting an infection, not just creatures. With no time to waste, they lit a fire and seared the wounds, driving the grubs out in a frenzy. Viola roared in pain, but the burning worked—the parasites shriveled and died, leaving her battered but alive.

### **Clues in the Sewers**

After patching themselves up, the party pressed on, finding a rusted gate leading into a forgotten tunnel choked with cobwebs. Ruby sent her flying squirrel to scout, but the path ahead remained shrouded in mystery. Nearby, a storm surge grate caught their attention, bearing a scrap of cloth. Investigating further, they uncovered a pile of oversized clothes, including a massive cloak made from bear fur.  

The tracks continued, leading them out of the sewers and into the town above.

### **The Stakeout**

The muddy trail led to an unremarkable house tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. The group took a cautious approach, staking out the area from a distance. A local family confirmed that a “very, very large half-orc” lived there. The group noted the simplicity of the homes in the area—one-room dwellings, with no apparent connection to the Clasp.  

Ruby’s flying squirrel slipped through a hole in the roof and spotted a gaunt man eating bread, surrounded by buckets. The house had no other visible exits.

### **The Bear**

After an hour of rest and planning, the group approached the house and knocked on the door. A massive half-orc opened it, his grin wide and welcoming—until his eyes fell on the adventurers. He sighed heavily, his shoulders drooping in resignation.  

Abokar broke the awkward silence with a blunt remark: “We found your clothes.”  

The half-orc’s laugh boomed through the quiet street, a deep belly laugh that seemed to echo endlessly. Viola, bristling with irritation, took it as mockery. Without warning, she hurled a rock at him in anger.  

The rock struck his chest with a dull thud, but it didn’t faze him. Instead, he cocked his head and chuckled. “If you’re here to fight,” he said, “I’m always up for a good brawl.”  

Before the situation could escalate, the rest of the group stepped in to calm things down. The half-orc shrugged, stepped aside, and waved them in. “Alright, then,” he said. “Come in. Let’s talk.”

Inside, he gathered food and drinks, dragging together a mismatched set of chairs. “I reckon you’ve got questions,” he said, settling into a chair that creaked under his weight. “But I’ve got one too.”

### **A Question of Lia**

The half-orc’s jovial demeanor shifted as he leaned forward, his massive hands clasped in front of him. “Where is Lia?” he asked. The question caught the adventurers off-guard. Viola narrowed her eyes. “You don’t know?”  

He shook his head, his expression darkening. “I’ve seen her—but it wasn’t her. Not really. Something’s taken her over. Something *wrong.*”  

The group shared a glance, unsure of what to say. When they suggested she might be dead, his growl rumbled low and menacing. “She’s not dead,” he insisted. “If she were, I’d know. She’s family.”  

He spoke of Lia with deep reverence, describing her as the heart of the Clasp, a protector of the downtrodden. He condemned the recent actions of the organization under the imposter’s leadership—assassinations, reckless operations, and betrayals of trust. “That’s not the Clasp,” he said, slamming his fist on the table. “That’s the Myriad’s style.”  

He revealed that she kept detailed records of all the Clasp’s connections and aid recipients, stored in her room at Greystone Manor. It’s the most secure spot in town.”  

Tension simmered as Viola, still on edge, pressed him for more details. “What else do you know? Anything useful? What are her exact routines?”  

The half-orc leaned back, a flicker of irritation crossing his face.

## **Session 18: Mirror Mirror On The Wall**

### **The Bear**

The Bear—a half-orc whom the group had tracked from The Wishing Well Casino—explained that without The Clasp protecting the little man, Kymal would be in a far worse state. The margrave’s strangehold on the city meant he cared only about squeezing out profits.

He revealed that their leader, Lia, had a secret book hidden in her room at Greystone Mansion. The book contained all the locations and names of those they had helped and who, in turn, helped them. The Clasp had noticed that Lia had stopped frequenting the Muddy Boot Inn in the evenings for a drink and some business. After about a week of absence, she reappeared—but she never stayed long enough to speak with anyone, not even him.

This had happened a few weeks ago. He explained that Lia’s orders had been sent to some of the more aggressive members of The Clasp, as well as to externally hired mercenaries, which made it difficult to spot the doppelganger impersonating her.

He wanted to hire the group to investigate and find Lia, for he believed she was still alive. At their request, he provided a code phrase to verify her identity: **"The City Drowns"** with the reply **"It is up to us to save it."**  
Ruby also persuaded the Bear to give her his magic ring in exchange for finding Lia—and he agreed.

### **It's Quiet, Too Quiet**

The group returned to Greystone Manor, but when they arrived, no one answered the door. The mansion was eerily quiet. Abokar made a thorough walk-around and noticed that their cart and horses were still there, which suggested that the others hadn’t left.

Nickolas tried the door, but it was locked. He insisted that no one should break in—after all, doing so would be illegal without clear evidence of trouble. Viola, however, sensed something was amiss. She had left the manor only a few hours earlier, and everyone was present except for Lia.

Determined to investigate, Viola scoured the walls and peered into every window. Finding no signs of fighting, struggle, or people, she eventually broke an upstairs window, climbed inside, and then carefully mended it.

Meanwhile, Idris and Nickolas began arguing. Idris wanted to force entry and investigate further, but Nickolas fired his crossbow near Idris’s head to warn him against breaking in. Abokar, meanwhile, searched the streets for guards but found none nearby.

---

### **The Door Opens**

Suddenly, the front door swung open to reveal Viola, who had unlocked it from the inside with her key. Despite her return, Nickolas maintained that there was no cause to break in. During their continued discussion, Ruby swiftly released her pet squirrel inside—just before Viola closed the door.

The sudden movement caused Idris to collide with the now-closed door. At the same time, Ruby’s squirrel scurried upstairs. Seated on a bench, Ruby peered through the squirrel’s eyes and noticed that one of the bedroom doors was partially open. The squirrel darted inside and began sniffing around; it climbed a clothing rack, glanced at the wall—and in that moment, Ruby’s vision went dark.

The last thing she saw was the reflection of Sir Squeeky, the squirrel. Nickolas decided to visit the captain of the guard, Huxley, to request backup if any guards were encountered along the way. Meanwhile, Viola also noticed the open door; she checked the room briefly and then slipped out through a window.

---

### **The Missing Squirrel**

Ruby recounted the strange incident with Sir Squeeky, prompting Idris to rush off. He scaled the side of the house via the window that Viola had used and forced his way inside. Noticing the partially open door, he investigated the room further.

The room appeared to have been ransacked—clothes hung on a rack—and on one wall, he spotted a mirror. Idris struck the mirror with a stick and suddenly saw the ghostly reflection of a floating, burning skull. This unnerved him, especially in light of Ruby’s earlier account. He closed his eyes, removed the mirror from the wall, and carried it downstairs. Then he opened the front door and presented the strange mirror to the group.

---

### **The Mystery of the Mirror**

The group set the mirror aside, taking care never to look directly at its reflection. Meanwhile, Ruby carefully performed a magic identification ritual on it. Viola noticed some writing along the mirror’s frame and used parchment and charcoal to make an imprint so she could decipher it.

The inscription revealed two riddles:  
> “What crosses a river without moving?”  
> “What knows all languages?”

With her ritual complete, Ruby determined that they were dealing with a **Mirror of Trapping**. When activated with a key word, if someone looks directly at their reflection, they are sucked into one of twelve prison cells in a dimension of smoke. Furthermore, when a name is spoken before the mirror, that person’s reflection appears, allowing for conversation. Uttering the number of a cell will reveal the creature contained within it.

---

### **Talking to Lia**

The group decided to suspend the mirror above the water in the fountain of the square outside the manor so that no one would see its reflections directly. They then summoned Lia and spoke with her.

At first, Lia suspected that a doppelganger was playing a trick on her, even warning that they would all die once she emerged. However, the group convinced her they were not in league with any impostor—and that they had slain the doppelganger—using the previously provided code phrase.

They learned that Lia had been captured, though she didn’t know for how long. A doppelganger had been impersonating her—the only entity she could communicate with. While she kept most of The Clasp’s secrets to herself, she inadvertently revealed some details that aided the doppelganger. Desperate, she pleaded for help to be freed.

---

### **Checking All the Cells**

The group began inspecting the mirror’s prison cells. In the first cell, they found a floating, flaming skull that remained silent. The second cell contained a strange, ghostly, screaming specter. Lia was found in the third cell. In the fourth cell, they discovered Mila—confused and terrified.

Boris was imprisoned in the fifth cell, aggressive and ready to fight. In the sixth cell, Halen Greystone explained that he had been searching for Mila and Boris—who had mysteriously vanished—only to become trapped inside the mirror along with the rest of his staff. The seventh cell held a panicked Sir Squeeky. The remaining cells were empty.

---

### **Solving the Riddles (and the Guards Arrive)**

The group realized that destroying the mirror would force everything trapped within it to escape at once—which could lead to a dangerous confrontation. The alternative was to speak the name of a person preceded by the appropriate code word.

They set to work solving the riddles. They quickly deduced that **“Bridge”** was the code word needed to toggle the mirror’s function. However, finding the code word required to extract someone proved more challenging.

Before they could resolve it, guards rushed into the square. Nickolas had contacted Captain Huxley and then hastily departed. The bewildered guards attempted to arrest everyone present. After some confusion—and perhaps persuasion—a guard started shouting words that might solve the final riddle: “What knows all languages?”  
Eventually, Abokar bellowed, “What!”  
The answer, as it turned out, was simply **“What”**—because “What knows all languages?”

Using the code word along with the names, the group managed to release everyone from the mirror. By that time, Nickolas had returned and was quickly brought up to speed.

---

### **Recuperating and Answers**

Everyone was grateful to have been freed. Mila, Boris, and Greystone were back at the manor, gathering in the kitchens for a drink to calm their nerves as they recounted the events. Lia explained how one day someone had managed to enter her room and hang the mirror up—leaving her little time to react.

She admitted she knew nothing about the Hum Dust, except that the doppelganger grew furious whenever it was mentioned—insisting that it be removed because it interfered with his own plans. He had been searching for a mysterious “shard,” yet the dust disrupted his detection methods. In his frustration, he had used The Clasp—with all its connections and wealth—to try and find the source and eliminate it. Lia had tried to extract more information, but aside from mentioning a shard and that it was the last one they needed to locate, she knew no more.

### **The Rewards**

Abokar took the mirror home. After removing a dried sausage from the wall, he placed the mirror in his living room and activated it before departing for the South Gate of the city. Viola had explained that she had secured an agreement to ride alongside a caravan bound for Westruun.

The Silvercut Crossroads lay on the way, and Abokar asked the group to help him investigate there—especially since he and other survivors from the old Ravager battle were suffering from wounds that would unpredictably reopen and close.

Meanwhile, Lia and several members of the group headed to The Bear for a reunion. Lia, along with a man who revealed his name to be Torren, discussed the havoc the doppelganger had wrought—ruining The Clasp’s treasury in Kymal and sullying their reputation with hired mercenaries. They debated strategies to conceal the incident. Ruby reminded Lia of their deal, and eventually Lia gave her the ring, promising Torren that she would find a new one for him. The ring, capable of casting *Disguise Self* once per day for one hour, bore the symbol of The Clasp. Lia also tried to persuade Idris and Ruby to join The Clasp, arguing that their aid would help protect the people of Kymal from Krishtan’s harmful actions. Although they declined, they received a letter of recommendation—and a word of caution that The Clasp operated quite independently in every city, so its influence might be limited.

---

### **On the Road**

The group eventually gathered at the South Gate, where a caravan awaited departure. Viola located them, and after brief introductions, they left the city together.

After about four hours on the road, they set up camp and got acquainted with the caravan’s members. The caravan was transporting discarded mining equipment to Westruun—since Kymal no longer needed it.

With the city receding behind them and the open road ahead, they journeyed onward. To their left, the shadow of Ironseat Ridge loomed; to their right, the dividing plains with its slowly rolling hills stretched as far as the eye could see. Their destination was the Silvercut Crossroads.

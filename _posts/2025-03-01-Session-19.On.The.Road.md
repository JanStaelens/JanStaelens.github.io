## **Session 19: On The Road**

### **Getting to Know the Caravan Members**

The group continued their travels, taking time to learn more about their new companions.

#### **1. Garron Holt – Caravan Leader**  
**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A broad-shouldered man in his late 40s with graying dark hair and a close-cut beard. He wears a weathered leather coat over chainmail and carries a longsword at his side. His confident stance and sharp eyes command respect.

---

#### **2. Dalia Voss – Scout and Tracker**  
**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A lean woman in her early 30s with a scar across her cheek and sun-weathered skin. She keeps her dark hair in a tight braid and wears a mottled green cloak over studded leather.

#### **3. Bram Gull – Veteran Guard**  
**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A burly man in his 50s with a shaved head and a thick gray beard. He wears half-plate armor and wields a heavy crossbow.

**Race:** Human

### **An Early Morning Surprise**

When they woke, a pungent smell greeted them. Tilda had cooked a hearty breakfast porridge, throwing in generous handfuls of herbs. Though edible, it brought tears to many eyes. Tilda, ever cheerful, urged everyone to eat up. Abokar, on the other hand, loved it and ate with gusto.

### **A Talk with Bram**

Around noon, Bram sat alone, staring out across the open fields, away from the rest of the group. He clutched a crumpled letter in one hand, occasionally balling the other into a fist. Abokar approached, asking if Bram was all right. At first, Bram hesitated, but Abokar had a gentle way with words, reminding him that sharing a burden sometimes lessens it.

Bram admitted he always felt off after visiting Kymal. Finally, he passed Abokar the letter.

#### **Letter from Joyce to Bram**  
*(Written on crumpled parchment, water-stained and smudged.)*

**Bram,**  

Did you think I’d never find out? That I’d never hear your name again?  

I followed your advice. **No begging. Stand strong.** And what did that get me?  

Nothing.  

The mines dried up. My work disappeared. And where were you? You never came back. You never looked. I lost everything, Bram.  

You’d probably say I should’ve “fought harder.” I tried. But this city doesn’t care. The only reason I still eat is a kind woman who leaves food in hidden places—**part of some secret group that actually helps people like me.** That’s more than you ever did.  

I hope you live long enough to regret it.  

**– Joyce**  

Bram confided that his daughter was somewhere in Kymal; he hasn’t seen her in ages and isn’t sure how to return to her life. He’s certain she’s tough enough to get by, but he doesn’t know exactly where she is. Abokar offered to help find her the next time they pass through Kymal. Bram thanked him but remained uneasy. Moments later, he stood and said it was time to move on.

### **An Encounter with a Mysterious Stranger**

Later that afternoon, Dalia, the scout, alerted everyone to the approach of a stranger. Garron warned the group to stay alert and let him handle any inquiries about their cargo.

They soon found a hooded, monk-like old man standing in the middle of the road with a small pushcart. He greeted them with theatrical excitement, proclaiming that they had arrived precisely where he foretold they would be. Opening a side cabinet on his cart, he pulled out a doily and placed a crystal ball on top with a flourish.

“Come, don’t be shy! For a mere five gold pieces, I can reveal your future!” he exclaimed, beckoning to the caravan.

Viola was tempted to skirt around him, but Garron pointed out the risk of getting stuck in the roadside mud. While they debated, Idris stepped forward, handed the man five gold, and mentioned his own connections to the spirit world. The old man nodded vigorously, lit some incense, and began his cryptic mutterings.

Viola, however, slipped out of sight, turned invisible, and crept around to the pushcart. She watched the stranger flick a hidden switch that filled the crystal ball with white mist, causing Idris to focus intently on the old man’s pronouncements about danger in the color green and the perils of water.

Unseen, Viola flicked the switch off, dispersing the mist. The old man sputtered, insisting the spirits were merely being shy. Idris grew suspicious, as the charlatan fumbled with his contraption. Eventually, Viola triggered the smoke device one last time after the old man had packed up his crystal ball, prompting Idris to demand a refund. Unknown to the so-called fortune-teller, Viola had already stolen back the gold. Panicked, the man crawled around looking for his coins.

Nickolas lost patience and advanced, unconcerned with the cart blocking the road. Abokar leapt in, hefting the pushcart in a single motion and hurling it into the nearby trees, where it splintered with a crash. The group moved on while the flustered man trudged back toward Kymal. Idris lingered briefly, hoping to retrieve the crystal orb, but found only broken pieces. With a quick sending to Huxley, he warned of the charlatan’s description before rejoining the caravan.

### **The Second Night**

That evening, they made camp. During Abokar’s watch, he tried showing Tobin how to properly patrol, though the young man only half-listened. Nickolas, on his own shift, noticed a faint glow beneath the pickaxes and mining equipment in one of the wagons. Curious, he asked Dalia about it when she returned from scouting. She brushed it off as harmless, insisting it was part of the shipment. Still, she lingered near the wagon after that.

At dawn, Tilda once again served up an intensely pungent porridge. She gave Abokar two extra portions, which he devoured happily.

### **Dalia’s Worries**

As the caravan continued the next day, Viola noticed Dalia acting more anxious than before. Rather than scouting far ahead, she stayed close, repeatedly glancing at Nickolas and whispering with Garron. Viola suggested they scout together. Once out of earshot, Viola confronted her about the unusual behavior.

Dalia confided that Garron trusts her, and he can sense trouble brewing. She admitted she wasn’t sure they could trust Nickolas—he seemed too aware of what they were hauling. She hinted that this supposedly “dried up” mineral source might still be producing, and if the Margrave of Kymal found out, he would only exploit it.

Viola advised her to act normal and stop raising suspicions, warning that Nickolas was sharp enough to keep digging if she seemed too nervous. Dalia nodded, though she still appeared unsettled.

### **A Nice Stew**

At midday, Ruby helped Tilda prepare a stew, curious about the potent herbs. Tilda began with standard ingredients—dried meat, potatoes, and carrots—then tossed in her usual fistful of herbs. Ruby pleaded for moderation, but Tilda laughed as if she’d heard a good joke. In a moment of inspiration, Ruby fished out a large melon from her Bag of Colding. Tilda looked puzzled at the strange “giant berry,” but shrugged and tossed it in anyway, followed by another hearty handful of herbs. Everyone except Viola, who was out scouting, tucked in. Abokar relished every bite, keeping up his energy as they drew closer to their destination.

### **An Ambush**

That afternoon, Viola—scouting ahead—heard a muffled cry from the caravan’s direction. She hurried back and spotted four small goblins hurriedly covering something with dirt and leaves near the road. “Good enough!” one of them whispered as they turned to leave. Without hesitation, Viola closed in, shifted into bear form, and attacked.

But it was a trap: an orc and three more goblins emerged. Even stranger, three of the “goblins” began flickering, one moment looking like goblins, the next like crudely painted planks. Viola roared, alerting the caravan. Abokar, Idris, and Bram sprinted forward, while the rest stayed back to guard the wagons.

One goblin’s arm wavered oddly, transforming into multiple arms that stabbed several times in a single thrust. Viola, in bear form, took the brunt of the assault. Reinforcements soon joined her, and they realized that fire was pretty effective. One by one, the enemies fell, leaving Viola exhausted from reverting to her normal form and then shifting back to a second bear shape in the heat of battle.

After the dust settled, Viola approached the spot where the goblins had been covering something. Brushing aside dirt and leaves, she froze. Lying there, lifeless, was Daria.

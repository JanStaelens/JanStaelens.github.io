## **Session 20: Dead Not-Dead Dead**

### **Aftermath of the Ambush**

As the dust settled from the ravager ambush, Viola cautiously approached Dalia, who lay lifeless, half-buried in dirt and leaves by the roadside. Leaning in to administer CPR, Viola jumped as Dalia's eyes suddenly shot open, a scream erupting from her throat as she convulsed in shock.

The caravan quickly rushed in, trying to soothe her panic. Between desperate gasps, Dalia began recounting how a goblin had stabbed her repeatedly at unnatural speed. Yet mid-explanation, she abruptly fell silent, collapsing again, utterly lifeless. Confusion rippled through the group as they moved supplies aside in the cart to rest her body. Meanwhile, Viola noticed her own wounds mysteriously healing and reopening—a disturbing echo of Abokar's previous afflictions and those of her former comrades.

### **Abokar's Introspection**

Abokar retreated inward, sifting through his memories of splintered wood and shattered shields, questioning whether these past battles were truly against goblins painted into existence. His reflections made him vulnerable, allowing the dark entity that held sway over him to slip into his thoughts. It whispered secrets—an alchemical ritual capable of restoring Dalia, freeing her from the torture of repeated death.

Abokar, shaken but resolute, pulled himself back to reality, the whispers lingering but unspoken to his companions.

### **Viola's Experiments**

Viola, troubled by her fluctuating wounds, theorized that each injury corresponded with the painted goblins' shifting states of existence. Despite Abokar's skepticism, he gathered the painted and real weapons scattered around the ambush site. Viola sorted them methodically, linking certain weapons to her injuries and others to Dalia's endless cycle of death and revival.

Holding onto the weapon that mirrored her wounds, Viola handed the one associated with Dalia to Tilda, who diligently watched over Dalia’s remains.

Abokar, meanwhile, performed his own experiment, burning a wooden painted weapon. Initially unremarkable, the ashes suddenly transformed into a wet sludge emitting an iron scent, shimmering subtly with metallic particles. Carefully, he collected samples for further analysis.

### **Distracted at Night**

On watch beneath a clear, star-filled sky, Ruby found herself captivated by a single, slow-moving star. Entranced, she felt comfort and certainty—a sense of being on the right path despite recent horrors. Lost in its glow, Ruby had no sense of passing time until Ronald shook her awake. Hours had vanished unnoticed. The night sky had shifted normally, except for that singular, unmoving light. Ronald, however, saw only ordinary stars.

### **A Recently Ambushed Caravan**

With the Silvercut crossroads mere hours away, the party came upon the wreckage of recently attacked carts ahead. Ruby and Ronald crept forward quietly, while Abokar and Nickolas acted openly as distractions. Viola quickly uncovered goblinoid tracks crisscrossing the road and weaving through the brush.

At the scene, they found fresh blood, both red and green, and signs indicating a shipment of pigment and painting supplies. Strangely, valuables and food remained untouched—the bandits had solely targeted art materials. The group concluded this had to be the same ravagers responsible for the painted goblins.

They decided to follow Viola’s discovered tracks, bidding farewell to Garron Holt's caravan, which hurried onward to Westruun, hoping temple healers could resolve Dalia's unnatural state. Viola warned Garron explicitly not to bury or burn Dalia, convinced the painted weaponry was the culprit. Garron thanked them gratefully before they parted ways.

### **Following the Tracks**

Tracking their quarry deeper into the Ironseat Ridge mountains, the party entered a narrow canyon, where the air chilled noticeably and echoes distorted their sounds. Sparse vegetation clung desperately between stone crevices, and towering peaks induced a sense of vertigo. At times, the sky vanished entirely as they moved briefly through cave passages.

The trail remained clear—scuffed earth and fragments of cloth hinted at bodies being dragged, explaining the absence of corpses at the caravan wreckage. Eventually, the passage opened into an expansive, hidden valley ringed by distant mountains.

### **Disturbed Dirt**

The tracks ended abruptly at patches of disturbed earth. Investigating cautiously, the group quickly uncovered multiple graves containing both skeletal and fresh corpses. Viola grimly determined they had all died from suffocation after being buried alive.

Ruby sent Sir Cheeky ahead for reconnaissance. The flying squirrel darted easily through the trees until reaching a wide clearing. Below, goblins patrolled, carrying more painted goblins, around a fortified hilltop encampment with crude wooden barricades and a large central hut.

They had found the ravagers' main camp.

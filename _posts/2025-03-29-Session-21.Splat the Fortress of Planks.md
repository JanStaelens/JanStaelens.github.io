## **Session 21: Splat the Fortress of Planks!**

### **Squirrel Recon & Goblin Plankception**

While the rest of the group continued searching for survivors in the mass grave outside the city, Ruby sent Sir Cheeky—her flying squirrel companion—on a scouting mission over the hill fort.

Sir Cheeky got dangerously close to several goblin patrols. Many of these goblins seemed to carry planks... that sometimes turned *into* goblins. Meanwhile, the original goblin turned *into* a plank. Ruby spotted more of these weird patrols, and from the treetops, she saw several inside the fortress. A massive, dead-looking tree towered over everything, its branches stretching higher than the keep itself.

Within the walls were several watchtowers—and, at the center of it all, a hulking, mutated goblin. Sometimes it had six arms. Sometimes it looked like it was standing, sitting, and lying down all at once. Its actions overlapped, like it was glitching through reality while painting feverishly.

Ruby relayed everything to the group, and a plan began to form.

### **Operation: Don’t Split the Party (Too Much)**

Abokar and Ruby would approach the clearing and attempt to quietly eliminate a goblin patrol. Meanwhile, Idris and Rono would sneak around toward the giant dead tree to infiltrate the fortress.

Nickolas and Viola remained hidden in the woods, watching from a distance.

With deft movements—and an invisibility spell—Idris and Rono scaled the giant tree, gaining a clear view of the goblins inside and the monstrous goblin artist. But before they could act, the sound of combat rang out below.

---

### **Ambush & Go**

Abokar and Ruby successfully isolated a patrol of the strange goblins. They sprang into action and swiftly took them down in a matter of seconds. Ruby, emboldened by the quick win, rushed forward, charging across the open field toward the fortress.

Her bold move triggered chaos. Goblins began pouring out of the fortress and manned their defenses, ready to meet the sudden threat.

---

### **Double Trouble: The Great Skirmish**

Rono and Idris leapt into the fortress, using the distraction outside to breach the wall. Goblins inside scrambled to respond, splitting the enemy's attention.

Back outside, Nickolas emerged, casting his magic to sow confusion among the enemy. Abokar barreled forward, drawing attention like a tank in a thunderstorm. The party had learned that even a single stab from these goblins could manifest as *dozens*—but Abokar’s heavy armor made him a frustrating target to crack.

Viola shifted into a massive wolf and tore into the goblins (and maybe a few planks disguised as goblins). Teeth met splinters. Blood met bark. Glorious carnage.

### **Glitch Boss Incoming**

A maddening roar echoed as the fortress gates burst open. A giant, grotesque goblin charged into the fray—crystal shard embedded in its twisted face, three versions of it overlapping like flickering illusions. One attack often became three.

Meanwhile, inside the fortress, disaster struck. Idris was caught and nearly downed by a stab-happy goblin. He and Rono scaled the wall again and fled the fortress.

---

### **Idris is Fine. No Wait. He's Dying. Nope—He's Fine Again.**

As Idris rejoined the battle, something bizarre began to happen: one moment he was bleeding out, the next, completely healed. The cycle repeated maddeningly—wounded, fine, wounded again—his body flipping between realities like a badly edited film.

---

### **One Goblin, Three Deaths (or Vice Versa)**

The party regrouped and focused all firepower on the mutated goblin. It was tough, resistant to both steel and spell, but eventually fell. As it died, the crystal embedded in its skull dislodged and fell to the ground with a resonant *thunk*.

Idris snatched it up, hiding it away. Rono caught a glimpse and, without hesitation, pulled his pistol and shot it point-blank. *BANG.*

Then again. *BANG.* And again. *BANG.*

But it wasn’t just Rono firing. It looked like dozens of Rono copies all shooting at once, surrounding the crystal. The bullets did nothing. Rono froze in place, trapped in a time-looped moment. Idris turned invisible and disappeared into the underbrush to keep the crystal hidden.

### **From Blood to Sawdust: Victory(?)**

The battle didn’t end with the big goblin’s fall. The remaining stabby goblins kept fighting, but the group rallied and finished them off—reducing them to a mix of blood, guts, sawdust, and splinters.

Idris’s wounds kept blinking in and out of existence, adding a surreal note to the bloody aftermath. As silence returned to the battlefield, the group realized something:

Though the fight was over, a heavy presence still lingered. A pressure they hadn’t noticed during combat now weighed on them. The air felt anxious, like something was holding its breath.

Was something still here?

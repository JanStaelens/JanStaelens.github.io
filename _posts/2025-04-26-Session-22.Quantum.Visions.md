## **Session 22: Quantum Visions!**

As the smoke from the burning goblin remains and painted planks filled the air, the party gathered around, wary and confused. Ruby's attempt to detect magic initially revealed nothing but lingering traces, until suddenly a powerful unknown magic resonated from the shard Idris had recovered.

Deciding to cast Identify, Ruby triggered an unexpected explosion of magical energy, rippling outwards and enveloping everyone. In an instant, the party was thrust into a shared tapestry of visions, vividly experiencing each other's memories and emotions—though only the vision’s focal character could control their actions.

### Ruby’s Visions

Ruby stood atop the high walls of Rosohna, her mothers Leylas and Quana at peace by her side. Essek approached warmly, arms wide for an embrace. Ruby attempted composure but flinched, betraying her unease.

Next, she found herself in dark ceremonial robes, standing alongside Essek before a vast army marching under twisted banners. When her deception failed, Essek called guards who attacked with gravity-warping dunamancy, forcing Ruby into desperate evasive maneuvers.

### Idris’s Visions

Idris found himself on a shadowy road deep within the Shadowfell, ghostly figures beckoning him into darkness. Panicked, he summoned spirits for aid, but they pursued him instead, forcing him to flee. Struggling with dual conflicting memories—one where he touched purple mist and teleported, another where a small creature leaped into the mist—he felt his head splitting from confusion.

In contrast, another vision returned Idris to his Xhorhasian clan’s comforting campfire, surrounded by smiling elders and playful children. Overwhelmed by confusion, he slapped himself awake, alarming his father and amusing his brother. As children laughed about "Uncle Idris," he grappled with a disorienting sense of multiple realities.

### Viola’s Visions

Viola first appeared bound tightly to a tree, dagger pressed against her own chest by her own hand. She closed her eyes, to ignore everything but she felt Arnoud Aborius stood before her. Refusing to engage, Viola drove the blade she felt into herself, hearing Arnoud's heartfelt gratitude for her compliance in his grim duty.

Her second vision placed her in an ornate, crystal-lit training hall surrounded by admiring brothers. Hands ablaze with powerful magic, Viola defiantly ignored the illusion, closing her eyes as her brothers, confused by her passivity, accidentally hurled lethal fireballs, bringing her vision to a tragic end.

### Abokar’s Visions

Abokar found himself chained to a dark altar, blood boiling in his veins as masked cultists chanted ominously. Summoning all his strength, he broke free, wielding chains as weapons against his captors, who screamed about "the infernal" escaping.

His next vision was peaceful yet grim; lying wounded on a battlefield, vultures circling above. The voice of the Allhammer warmly welcomed his soul. Accepting this fate, Abokar felt the quiet peace of release, offering no resistance. Idris, trapped within Abokar’s body, desperately attempted spells to fight back but found himself powerless, ultimately succumbing alongside Abokar, who was greeted by a massive dwarf seated proudly upon his throne.

### Nickolas’s Visions

Nickolas stood confidently in a courtroom in Emon, declared innocent by the judge. His father sat proudly, reserved but clearly pleased. Walking away together, he absorbed the rare moment of paternal pride.

In a stark contrast, Nickolas later walked through Kymal, feared and respected. Behind him, the Muddy Boot Inn lay shattered. Citizens fled before him, shouting warnings about "the Arbiter." Though powerful and feared, Nickolas silently began restoring order, cleaning the chaos left behind.

### Aftermath & Revelations

As the visions faded, the party realized they'd intimately shared each other's deepest experiences. Ruby soon identified the recovered artifact as the Quantum Shard, a fragment of something larger—the Celestia Prism.

Attuning to the shard, Ruby immediately felt its demanding strain. Using its power, she successfully cast Quantum Collapse, undoing reality itself to erase the goblin-plank weapons' existence. Each use of the shard brought a disturbing sensation, a brief halt in reality, revealing the dangerous fragility of manipulating parallel worlds.

Meanwhile, Idris explored the mutated goblin leader’s hut, where space twisted erratically, cycling through multiple versions of the interior in a chaotic, glitchy dance. Attempts to retrieve or interact with items proved futile or hazardous, ultimately leading Abokar to set fire to all realities of the hut in exasperation.

### Questions & Concerns

Gathering their thoughts, the party pondered deeply on the nature of these strange events. Why had Abokar stopped receiving wounds years ago, only to become vulnerable again recently? What did the goblin’s appearance during the massive battle three years ago imply?

Exhausted from the mental strain and Ruby’s overuse of the shard, the group returned to the safety of the mountain road, establishing a camp to rest and recover. However, peace was short-lived; during his watch, Nickolas noticed the unsettling gleam of eyes watching them from the shadows.

A sense of unease lingered—perhaps the worst was yet to come.

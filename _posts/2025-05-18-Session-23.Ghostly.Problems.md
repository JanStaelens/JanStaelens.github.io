## **Session 23: Ghostly Problems**

### Awakened with a Cry

Abokar stared into the darkness, spotting eyes glinting in the night—larger than a cat's. Taking no chances, he slashed his hand, igniting his weapon in flame. The flash triggered an immediate reaction. From the shadows, a figure screamed and charged at him.

The scream jolted the camp awake. A humanoid shape, twisted in rage, rushed forward. The voice was both masculine and monstrous—something was deeply wrong.

Nickolas quickly lit his lantern, revealing a man clad in chainmail, eyes stark white, mouth foaming, moving with strange, jerky motions. Each step left behind a faint echo or vapor trail.

Abokar struck with his flaming weapon, but the fire seemed to empower the man, whose own weapon burst into flames. Ruby sprinted forward to assist Abokar.

Idris disappeared into a tree, and Viola melted into the shadows.

### The Man Dies, the Creature Remains

In a brief but brutal clash, Abokar decapitated the raving attacker. The body crumpled—but in its place, a ghostly wail erupted. A translucent specter lingered, howling.

The scream struck Ruby with such terror that she felt her life force drain—she aged 60 years in moments.

The spirit then lunged into Abokar, possessing him. His eyes turned white as he moved erratically and lunged at Nickolas with jarring, unnatural swings.

Viola emerged and touched Abokar, attempting to purge the evil. Nickolas invoked Turn Undead, but it failed to drive the entity out. Idris, recalling lore of powerful ghosts, realized they would either need powerful magic or to knock the possessed body unconscious.

Shouting arcane insults, Idris injured Abokar. Viola, now a wild boar, charged to knock him down. Ruby, shaking off her terror despite her aged body, joined the fray with shadowy blades, using them like a cane for support.

Eventually, Nickolas cast *Command*, and Ruby struck with *Booming Blade*. However Abokar was knocked out before that. The ghost was expelled and raged violently, striking with necrotic fury. As Abokar was healed, he obeyed the command and moved, he triggered opportunity attacks and the delayed booming magic. 

Together, the party eventually brought the entity down, exhausted but victorious.

### The Interrogation

Idris cast *Speak with Dead* on the attacker’s severed head. Meanwhile, Abokar discovered a tattoo—a drop of blood with a dagger—the mark of the Claret Order, the same group from his visions. He also found a cryptic note referencing shadows as the key, along with a crude sketch of the Silvercut Crossroads monument.

Idris asked:

**Where did you come from?**
"I came from the crypts under the Silvercut Crossroads."

**Why were you there?**
"I was looking for the treasures of the Claret Order."

**Were you part of the Claret Order?**
"I was a junior member. They didn't let me into the Silvercut Crossroads cache. I ran away to find their treasures."

**Why did you do that?**
"I want the wealth and power their artifacts will surely give me."

### Trying to Fix Ruby

While Nickolas tracked the man’s trail, Viola attempted to dispel the magic aging Ruby. The spell seemed to fail—Ruby fled into a tent in tears, cycling through grief. Moments later, she emerged youthful again. Viola surmised the spell worked, but with a delay.

The group rested, examining the cryptic note.

### Travel to the Crossroads

On the road, Ruby’s illusion magic wore off again. Viola cast *Dispel Magic*, but again it seemed ineffective.

The party debated whether to stop at the Crossroads or catch up with the caravan—particularly to help Dalia Vos, last seen caught in a horrific quantum state of life and death. Viola volunteered to transform into a horse to carry Ruby ahead, but Nickolas warned against splitting the group. He argued they should move as a unit, skipping the crypts if needed, and catch up with the caravan together.

### The Silvercut Crossroads

They arrived at the crossroads monument—an obelisk surrounded by four warrior statues, each flanked by unlit braziers. Nickolas was ready to move on, but Abokar paused to examine the area and spotted a Claret Order symbol scratched onto a nearby rock.

Ruby used her Quantum Shard to detect nearby magic. No quantum magic was found, but she did sense protection magic emanating from the moss on the obelisk.

Idris eagerly lit all four braziers. Abokar noticed the moss on the obelisk reacted to the shadows of the statues. He instructed the group to strike poses matching the statues, allowing their shadows to fall onto the obelisk.

Reluctantly, Nickolas complied. After 30 seconds, the moss glowed brightly, then vanished, revealing a hidden staircase into the obelisk.

### The Crypt Entrance

Ruby sent Sir Cheeky, her flying squirrel, to scout. Inside was a small crypt chamber, stone slabs, and a single imposing door with a massive skull set with two diamond eyes—one dull and gray, the other brilliant and clear.

The party descended and examined the door. Above it was an inscription in Celestial, which Idris translated:

> "Its gaze will burn, its beauty lies—
> Touch not the gleam that guards the eyes.
> What once turned to dust may turn once more—
> Twist the past to open the door."

Despite Viola’s caution, Idris touched the door and the dull & grey gem, with no result. Nickolas held up a torch, trying something with the fire to no effect. Eventually, Abokar realized the skull could be rotated. With a loud *click*, the door opened.

### Small or Large?

The next series of rooms featured two doors each—one small, one large—and riddles on the walls. Ruby had cast *Comprehend Languages* and joined Idris in deciphering the clues.

> "I break the ground with thunder’s pace, but shatter when I lose the race."

The group knocked and opened the small door.

> "Tall I stand with towering pride, yet shadows slip right past my side."

They cleverly observed that the small door retained shadows unnaturally longer. They decided the larger door is normal so they choose it as their passage.

### The Gargoyle

Finally, they entered a large crypt chamber. Ahead, a massive gargoyle statue blocked a corridor. Though unmoving, its gaze seemed to track them—a silent sentinel, ancient and ominous.

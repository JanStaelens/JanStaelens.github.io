## **Session 24: Silvercut Crossroads**

### The Gargoyle

The group entered a large crypt chamber. Ahead, a massive gargoyle statue blocked the corridor. Though unmoving, its gaze seemed to follow them—a silent sentinel, ancient and ominous.

On the ground were three bowls: one gold, one iron, and one wooden. On the walls, carved as part of the original architecture, was the inscription:

> “Made by kings, forged for war, or shaped by humble hand—  
> I care not for wealth, nor wrath, but what the living give unplanned.  
> The gift must come from deep within,  
> Poured with pain, and not with sin.”

The gargoyle’s clawed hands were held out in front of it, as if to receive one of the bowls. Above it, holes in the ceiling matched the shape and size of its hands.

Idris peered through a gap between the gargoyle’s wings and saw a 15-foot-wide pit in the corridor beyond.

Piecing together the clues, Ruby took the wooden bowl, placed it in the gargoyle's hands, then slashed her palm and dripped blood into it. The gargoyle lifted its head, examined the group, then retracted into the ceiling—its hands jamming into the overhead holes—leaving the passage clear.

### The Corridor

The group found the corridor blocked by a pit lined with spikes. Viola, however, walked calmly along the wall and ceiling, carrying a long rope. One end was held by Abokar, while she tied the other to a barred door at the corridor’s end.

Nickolas tested a wall sconce to see if it could hold the rope. It came loose on a hinge with a click. Curious, he pulled it again—more clicks, but no clear effect. Idris reached a second sconce further along, but it was stuck. When he stepped onto the floor on the far side of the pit, it collapsed, revealing a deeper trap beneath.

Nickolas pulled the sconce again—this time, locking the trap in place. Using the rope, he crossed safely, and Abokar leapt across, though the floor creaked ominously under his weight.

### Finding a Hole

At the end of the corridor, they entered a small crypt chamber with chairs and a table—furniture clearly added later. A ruined tomb dedicated to the Platinum Dragon, god of lawful good, life, and war, stood desecrated. Large, purple concentric circles were scrawled wildly across the room.

Upon closer inspection, they found handwritten text in an unknown language. Ruby deciphered it partially—curses against the Platinum Dragon, along with phrases like: *The Eye opened. The Eye showed us the way.* Also: *CLOSE—but we must dig deeper. The Eye says to dig deeper!*

Meanwhile, Viola began hearing a distant, repetitive electrical sound: *KKzzzz... KKKzkzzz...*

Nickolas discovered several discarded notes—doodles from boredom, and a sheet tallying roughly 30 days, dated three years ago. Oddly, there was a single newer entry from less than a month ago: *Cael was here!*

In the tomb, they found a hole. Ruby sent her squirrel to investigate. It led to a tunnel with branching dead-ends, though one seemed to lead outside, hidden by planks and vegetation. The tunnel had clearly been dug from within the tomb, widened crudely with makeshift tools.

### If You Are Pure and Good, Then Walk

Returning to the corridor, they opened a second door—revealing a room-spanning pit that appeared bottomless. At the far end, golden script read: *“If you are pure and good, then walk.”*

The phrase reminded Nickolas of the stolen *Amulet of Pure Good*, which allows one to mask their alignment. He debated with Viola, arguing that true goodness doesn’t exist.

Viola attempted to climb the walls but couldn’t stick to them. Neither could Idris gain a grip. Nickolas, despite Viola's encouragement, found no invisible bridge.

Tied with a safety rope, Ruby stepped forward and—after a brief fall—landed on an invisible bridge, allowing her to cross.

She explored one room filled with chains and pedestals. Mistaking it for a torture chamber, she noticed a flag bearing the Claret Order’s symbol and closed the door without entering further. She crossed to a set of double doors, opening them to a massive chamber beyond.

From across the pit, Abokar glimpsed the room and was struck by a powerful sense of déjà vu—something just out of reach.

### The Great Tomb Chamber

Ruby described what she saw: a grand chamber once dedicated to the Platinum Dragon, now ransacked. Paint covered the walls; strange purple markings defiled every surface. Text cursed the Platinum Dragon and praised "the Eye," celebrating some unnamed success.

Chains lay broken across the floor, pillars were toppled, and items once placed on pedestals were missing. Ruby identified a massive destroyed and disrupted *Dispel Magic* ritual focused on the central tomb that was, from which the repeating *KKkzzzzzp... KKKZZZzzzp* noise emanated.

Meanwhile, Abokar and the others entered through one of the dug tunnels, breaking through into the same chamber.

### Dangerous Items

Scattered plaques described the dangerous items once stored here:

- **Scroll A-17: Withering Pact**  
  *Do not read aloud. Causes irreversible soul decay.*

- **Chain E-11: Zealot’s Embrace**  
  *Induces obedience to demonic will. Do not wear.*

- **Artifact B-04: Idol of Vurozz**  
  *Silences all sound within 10 ft. Prolonged exposure leads to madness.*

- **[Broken Plaque]**  
  *Ge** *: Whi*** **re  
  Contains bound soul fragments. Emits auditory hallucinations.*

The items were missing, but Idris was enraged—"the soul is a sacred thing."

### The Quantum Tomb

Inside the central tomb, they found another crudely dug hole. Within were old weapons and planks painted to look like weapons—*KKZZHHH*—they flickered between realities. When some became real, Abokar felt an old wound reopen.

At the center was a stone pedestal with two metal prongs—clearly meant to hold an item. Using *Detect Magic* via the Quantum Shard, Ruby saw the tomb glowed with quantum magic—especially the prongs.

She gathered the old weapons. During the process, she stepped on a stone slate with Common writing.

After puzzling it together, they read:

**Object ID:** X-01-Ω  
**Designation:** The Shard of Unknown Magic  

| Date                 | Examiner                 | Summary                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 988 PD, 5 Duscar     | Scribe Leren Voss        | Field stable. Minor reality bleed detected. Containment holding.        |
| 989 PD, 17 Sydenstar | Arcanist Elra Dynn       | Noted increased resonance. Recalibrated null field.                     |
| 999 PD, 9 Fessuran   | Inquisitor Jhalen Thorne | Rumors of similar effect near Stilben. Scheduled for reassessment.      |

The last entry was from just over a month ago.

Ruby then used the Quantum Shard to collapse reality into a version where the painted weapons never existed. Sweat poured from her face under the strain.

### The Lab Antechamber

All but Viola crossed into the small room bearing the Claret Order flag. It was pristine—untouched by looters. Two pedestals held chained-down objects:

- **Object ID:** L-07-V  
  **Designation:** Lantern of Lost Names  
  *Glows in presence of forgotten memories. Sometimes utters names in Deep Speech.*

- **Object ID:** C-21-R  
  **Designation:** Coin of Twinned Paths  
  *When flipped at a crossroads, reveals both choices’ first consequences.*

Idris took both. Upon touching the lantern, a guttural word in Deep Speech echoed around them, and the lantern began to glow.

Behind the flag was nothing but a wall.

### The Lab

Abokar entered the main lab—a converted temple of the Platinum Dragon. Mosaics depicted the Calamity, showing the Platinum Dragon’s armies triumphing over the Betrayer Gods. But the altar had been converted into a metal-clad bed with chains and tubes.

Abokar froze. He recognized the place from nightmares—rituals he had interrupted while restrained to that very bed. He suddenly knew exactly how to use the device to bring someone back from the dead.

Without hesitation, Abokar furiously deconstructed the altar-bed, flinging parts across the room. Idris, Ruby, and Nickolas entered carefully, keeping their distance.

The lab had been turned into a research site. Bookshelves stood empty, but tucked behind them were notes:

**Excerpt – Observation Deck, Day 4**  
*"When held near other cursed objects, the shard induces resonance. Reality thins. The term ‘quantum curse’ was coined here, but feels insufficient. It’s more like the rules are debating themselves."*

Another document detailed a subject:

### Fierna

Abokar calmed slightly, though not before grabbing the lantern from Idris his hands and throwing that against a wall, breaking the glass of the lantern. Idris let it go and decided to examined the broken chains from the bed—etched with repeating infernal runes. He spoke the word aloud: *Fierna*.

Abokar’s blood boiled. Flames erupted briefly from within him as he screamed and lunged at Idris in rage. Idris narrowly dodged.

"NEVER say that word again!" echoed across the crypt.

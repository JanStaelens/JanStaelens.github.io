## **Session 25: Demon Summoning And Coin Flipping**

### Putting Pieces Together

The group regrouped with Viola, who had remained behind in the previous crypt chamber. As tensions eased, they began discussing what they had discovered, piecing together a rough timeline of events. They speculated that Belthra Cael may have been resurrected under a contract—perhaps something akin to Abokar's own fate.

They theorized that the Claret Order returned to the crypt annually to check on the shard and maintain the containment rituals. The last visit appeared to have been just a month ago. They debated whether goblins had dug into the crypt and stolen the shard—or whether a cult of "The Eye" took the shard, with the goblins looting the remains.

Whatever the case, several dangerous items had clearly been removed—possibly including another shard, or the one they now held. Another clue hinted that the Claret Order had traveled to Stilben, investigating rumors of similar quantum effects occurring there.

### Through the Goblin Tunnels

To Ruby’s dismay, the group used the goblin-dug tunnels to exit the crypt. Crawling through the tight, dirty passages, they eventually reached a crude hatch at the end. Light poured in from outside, along with the sound of birds and wind in the trees.

But the fresh air was tainted by a strange stench of decay. Listening carefully, they heard a guttural, rhythmic chanting nearby.

The group split up—those skilled in stealth moved ahead to scout the source of the sound.

### The Demon Summoning

They found a twitching goblin, surrounded by black smoke and ritual markings drawn in goblin blood. Many goblin corpses lay nearby, slowly burning and being consumed by the dark smoke.

Around the black smoke stood four ritual circles, each with a blue flame. The goblin moved erratically, clearly not in control of itself, its fearful eyes wide as it chanted frantically. Then, from two of the flames, creatures the group recognized—**Dretches**—crawled forth.

### Decisive Action

Viola rushed back to inform Nickolas and Abokar. Without hesitation, Abokar grabbed his axe and charged. Ruby moved to disrupt the ritual, sneaking up to one of the blue flames and disturbing the circle around it. The flame vanished. The Dretches howled in anger, and the goblin paused before resuming its frenzied chanting.

As Ruby neared the rift, she caught a glimpse of the **Abyss** beyond—twisting horrors and hungering eyes that chilled her to the core.

### Stop the Ritual!

Idris loosed arrows. Abokar’s axe burned with green flame as he struck. More Dretches emerged from the remaining circles, prompting Ruby to disrupt two more, each time suffering a wave of psychic dread. Viola, unnoticed, disabled the final circle.

Only the goblin remained—chanting still, despite injury. Around its neck, a large, animate chain constricted and whispered to it, clearly influencing its actions.

From the dark portal, a massive orange-furred hand reached through, clawing at the edges of the rift.

Idris cast **Tasha’s Hideous Laughter**, and the goblin collapsed, laughing uncontrollably.

### Silence!

Yet, the goblin rose again like a puppet on strings—twitching and chanting. Nickolas rummaged through his pack, produced a scroll, and read it aloud. **Silence** fell over the scene. The goblin continued mouthing words, but no sound came.

The summoning circle stopped growing. The demonic hand clawed at the rift, unable to pass through.

### Axe to the Face

Abokar slipped into the shadows and gazed into the rift—seeing the **Abyss** fully now. A **Barlgura**—a monstrous, ape-like demon with orange fur and tusks—was forcing its way toward the portal.

Ruby joined him. Her horror deepened as she saw not one, but **several** of the creatures converging on the rift.

With combined effort—and the might of Abokar’s axe—the goblin was slain. Its body dissolved into shadow, and the rift collapsed, severing the Barlgura’s hand, which fell to the ground, twitching.

### Loot and Resting

Investigating the scene, the group deduced that a recent battle had occurred—goblins fighting among themselves. Around the goblin's neck, they found the cursed item:

- **Chain E-11: Zealot’s Embrace**  
  *Induces obedience to demonic will. Do not wear.*

They carefully wrapped it in cloth and stuffed it into Nickolas’s **Bag of Holding**. A faint whisper of rage echoed from the chain as it disappeared.

Meanwhile, Viola inspected the severed hand. It matched descriptions from an old play by Arnaud—one of the villains was a leaping orange ape. It had been inspired by a **Barlgura**, which Viola had once dismissed as fiction.

Among the corpses, the group found gems worth 10 gold and a healing potion.

They took a short rest.

### Coin of Twinned Paths

Idris experimented with the items recovered from the Claret Order cache. The **Lantern of Lost Names** never stopped glowing dimly—suggesting forgotten memories. Occasionally, it shouted names in **Deep Speech**.

At the **Silvercut Crossroads**, Idris flipped the **Coin of Twinned Paths**, wondering: what if they returned to **Kymal**, or continued to **Westruun**?

The coin spun mid-air. Idris’s eyes turned white, his head thrown back. In a trance, he saw two paths:

- First, the group walking back to Kymal—until they surrounded a man hanging upside-down from a tree. The man screeched a nasal **"ééééééééé"** before the vision ended.

- Then, they saw themselves heading to Westruun—two days passed in seconds, until a vision appeared: an upside-down **wagon**, floating.

The vision ended. Idris collapsed—**blind**. His companions panicked as he stumbled and groped around, though some couldn’t resist cracking a few eye jokes.

### A Long Rest

To save time, **Viola transformed into a horse** to carry Idris as they hurried to catch up with the caravan. The caravan was transporting **Dalia Vos**, a victim of quantum effects—locked in an endless loop of dying and reviving.

That night, they made camp.

- **Abokar’s watch** passed without issue—a peaceful night beneath a starry sky.  
- **Viola**, having massaged Idris's head earlier (and dreamed of shadowy worlds and sore feet), took second watch. She noticed a **bright star** that moved oddly—unlike any other. She didn’t recall seeing it before.  
- **Nickolas**, on third watch, tried to track the star’s movement but was thwarted by clouds.  
- **Ruby**, on final watch, immediately found the star—and became **entranced**. The world faded away. She felt safe—at home.

Idris, still blind, stirred but fell back asleep. Abokar awoke, confused by the high sun. He rushed to find Ruby standing motionless, eyes fixed on the sky. Shaking her free, she realized she had lost **hours**.

Abokar’s grumbling woke everyone. “In a hurry to catch a caravan, and we’re standing around star-gazing...”

Nickolas used **Remove Curse** on Idris—restoring his sight.

They quickly packed up and began the new day.

## **Session 26: The Caravan is Floating**

### What's Wrong with Ruby

As the group continued their fast-paced journey to make up for lost time, talk turned once again to Ruby.

It was the second night in a row she’d fallen into a catatonic state—staring blankly up at a bright, strange star in the direction they were headed. Theories flew. Ruby said it made her feel “like home.” But none of the others felt the same. Maybe it was tied to her connection with the quantum shard? But then again, she had already been acting this way before they even possessed the shard.

Could it be something about her homeland? She tried to trace the star’s direction to her continent of origin, but it didn’t line up. If anything, the star seemed to hang northeast—towards Westruun and Whitestone, not the Krynn Dynasty.

Idris spoke with Viola and asked if she might use her mysterious massage ability to "see" what Ruby sees in her dreams. Ruby, surprised to hear Viola might even *have* such a power, noted that only very powerful magic could normally affect dreams like that. She wasn’t opposed—but she wasn’t ready to try it just yet.

### The Next Night

To avoid another episode, Ruby was taken off night watch. Still, that night several people noticed something odd—riders with torches far off in the distance. They moved restlessly across the plains, never approaching, never leaving. The group kept an eye on them, but aside from their unsettling presence, nothing happened.

Later that night, Ruby left the tent briefly to relieve herself. When she returned, a glint of light caught her eye—and she froze. Once again, the star had her.

Abokar, noticing her, rushed to wake Viola, but she just waved him off, too tired to deal with any of it that night.

Ruby eventually snapped out of it with help from Idris and Abokar and quietly returned to bed.

### The Caravan is Upside Down

By midday, the group had made excellent time—only to stop dead in their tracks.

Floating a few feet above the road was the caravan they were trying to catch.

Upside-down.

Alongside it, slowly spinning and suspended in the air, was a second wagon. On its side: **TumbleToys – Whiterun’s Finest**. Scattered all around them were glowing white rocks and a surreal assortment of floating toys.

Both caravans’ members were helplessly drifting mid-air, lips cracked and dry—seemingly stuck like this for hours. The only one not caught in the phenomenon was Tobin, who was frantically tinkering with something when the group startled him.

Tobin explained that this had started the day before. He’d been relieving himself so wasn't stuck in the effect and has been trying to build a catapult of sorts—something that could launch an object *into* the field at high speed. Normal throws lost all momentum once they crossed the boundary. Abokar had already tested that—rocks and tools simply *floated*.

Tobin had marked the edge of the effect in the dirt, and the boundary hadn’t shifted since.

Seeing the group arrive, Tobin and the stranded caravan members lit up with hope.

Nickolas did ask why Tobin didn't just use a very long stick instead of building such a complex device. *oops*

### From Bad to Worse

Eager to investigate, Ruby pulled out the Quantum Shard and cast an enhanced *Detect Magic* through it.

Bad idea.

The shard began to hum with an ominous resonance—and the field erupted into chaos.

Objects and people were violently flung back and forth within the floating zone. A toy slammed into the head of the TumbleToys driver, knocking him out cold. A spinning fighter, likely a bodyguard, lost what little control he had—vomiting midair before passing out.

Ruby, however, did manage to glean a painful insight: this was yet another unknown form of magic. A third “flavor,” distinct from the Quantum effects or the Hum Dust they’d seen before.

Realizing the shard was aggravating the effect, she moved far away. The field stabilized *slightly*—but toys and rocks still careened around in unnatural flight.

Some of the toys even spoke when hitting things, all the same feminine voice:

- “Up, up, away!”
- “Down is up—float forever!”
- “Don’t hold too close!”

### Get People Out!

The group started working on a plan to retrieve the floating victims.

Idris tied himself to Viola, who braced herself and walked across the effect, sticking to the ground with her abilities. Step by step, Idris was plunged into the zone—dodging toys and debris as best he could. After a series of hard knocks to the head, he managed to pull out almost everyone, including Dalia Vos, who appeared in several overlapping forms—glitching in and out.

Nickolas, Abokar, and Tobin worked in parallel to construct a long pole with a hooked end. After a few iterations, it worked—they used it to snag Tilda and pull her back to safety.

With Idris exhausted, Ruby took over. She handed Nickolas the Bag of Colding containing the shard and entered the zone. Compared to Idris, she moved like an expert—swiftly rescuing the last two people without issue.

### The Effect Moves, Then Fades

At some point, the group’s efforts triggered a shift.

The field began to move, drifting slowly in their direction. But as it moved, its power lessened—until, finally, everything dropped. Carts gently lowered, rocks and toys landing to the earth once more.

They calmed the panicked horses and flipped the wagons upright. Idris, ever the opportunist, managed to swipe both a glowing rock and one of the speaking toys during the rescue.

### Barnaby “Barnie” Fizzlewick

One of the caravan leaders, Barnaby—“Barnie” to most—was healed by Idris but clearly shaken. He lashed out at Garron, the other caravan leader, demanding to know what *he* had done to his toys.

Strangely, some of the toys still floated on their own—even outside the field.

Barnie admitted this floating was normal. The toys were crafted in Whitestone, and there *had* been rumors that under certain conditions they acted... unpredictably. But those were just stories. Nothing had ever happened like *this*.

Competition trying to discredit them, maybe?

Idris calmed everyone down. As thanks, Barnie handed over a few of the curious toys to Idris for helping him and his bodyguard escape.

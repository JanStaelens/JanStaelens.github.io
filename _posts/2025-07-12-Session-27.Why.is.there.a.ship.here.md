**Session 27: Why is there a ship here?**

### Barnaby “Barnie” Fizzlewick

Barnaby's guard—who revealed his name as Tomas to Abokar—was busy collecting all the toys and putting them back into crates. Abokar, who was helping out, was baffled that the toys wouldn’t stay down. Tomas explained this was normal for these toys—apparently, they’re meant for rich kids. That might be true, as Idris asked if he could buy one of the toys from Barnaby, who enthusiastically picked one up off the ground, dusted it off, and sold it to Idris for 2 gold.

Barnaby once again insisted they’re perfectly safe. This strange behavior had never happened before, and he wasn’t sure what caused such... explosive reactions.


### Idris Experiments

Idris, now in possession of the floating doll, approached everyone to see if it would react. Nothing happened—until he neared Dalia. The moment the doll was brought close to her, it suddenly whipped out of his hands and shot over 60 feet into the air. Everyone looked stunned as they watched the doll slowly float back down—at which point Abokar caught it mid-air.

### Quantum Interactions?

Meanwhile, Ruby had gone to recover the weapons, which were apparently stored near Dalia’s body. She walked a short distance away from the caravans, waiting for Dalia to shift into her "living" quantum state before using the quantum shard to collapse realities into one where the painted weapons had never been created.

However, as she waited, Barnie’s caravan began moving again—heading closer to Ruby—when she noticed the weapons on the ground vibrating more and more violently. At the same time, the shard in her hand began to hum and slightly vibrate. Putting two and two together, Ruby quickly called out for Barnie to stop! She warned him that proximity to what she was doing could cause another explosion.

Barnie wisely decided not to ask further questions. With help from Nickolas, Abokar, and Tomas, they cleared away some brush so Barnie’s caravan could go off-road and avoid Ruby’s position.

### Collapse!

A scream cut through the air—Dalia, alive again and without wounds, screamed in horror. Ruby wasted no time. Focusing her will and mind through the shard, she saw infinite possibilities and realities, picked the right quantum state, plucked its string, and collapsed reality into that version. The weapons in front of her vanished—either never having existed or erased in that moment. Dalia, now being tended to by Tilda the healer, slowly calmed down, though she remained in shock. She no longer seemed dead, nor reverted to her prior state.

### Travel Continues

The group rejoined the caravan heading toward Westruun, and several days passed. Ruby remained entranced by the bright star in the night sky, never fully able to resist its strange pull. Abokar noticed that as the days went on, and they traveled closer to Westruun, the star seemed to grow brighter and higher in the sky.

At one point, discussing this with Garron, the man remarked that it almost looked like something above Westruun itself. Abokar focused his keen sight on the now-closer star—just as a cloud passed in front of it, dimming the light—and noticed a shape. It looked like... a sail-less ship?

A discussion followed. The concept of airships wasn't unfamiliar to those who’d traveled through major trade cities—but none had ever heard of one glowing or causing strange trances like this. The mystery remained.

### Tobin Wants to Fly Without Magic

At one point, Nickolas asked Tobin what he kept tinkering with during the travels. Tobin excitedly showed him a small prototype made of parchment, string, and wood. He aimed and threw it—everyone watched as it floated and flew a good distance before landing harshly on its tip with a crack.

Blushing, Tobin admitted he needed to figure out the landing part. He explained that if he could make it work, he could build one large enough to strap to his back and—by jumping off a mountain—cover great distances at high speed, all without magic. Ruby teased that teleportation magic was still faster, but Nickolas was intrigued and began helping Tobin refine the design.

### Idris Discovers Something—at a Cost

At night, Idris couldn’t stop thinking about the dolls and the strange magic surrounding them. Burning with curiosity, he tried to experiment during his watch—but Garron, who was on watch with him, caught him and firmly forbade it. He told Idris to wait until morning and to include the others, away from the caravan. Garron’s priority was keeping everyone safe.

Idris claimed he didn’t mind going further away right now, but Garron reminded him he was part of the caravan.

As Garron became distracted by the distant riders with torches—patrolling the wilderness like they had for many nights—Idris seized the moment. He pulled out the stolen unrefined hum dust from Ruby’s bag and rubbed it against the head of the floating doll.

Immediately, there was a flash. The doll catapulted skyward at great speed, and Idris screamed in pain as his finger disintegrated.

### The Group Awakens to Theorize

Garron, alerted by the sound and flash, shouted everyone awake. Abokar jumped up, ready for battle. The rest of the caravan, on edge, saw Garron harshly admonishing Idris for his recklessness.

It quickly became clear Idris had lost a finger. He tried—somewhat successfully—to convince a few people it was an accident, but others saw through it. Ruby, discovering her stolen hum dust, was livid and demanded it back. Idris had hidden it in his bedroll, claiming it stung too much when kept in his pocket.

Abokar noticed the toy slowly falling back down. Its head was disintegrated. Even worse—it now lay flat on the ground, no longer hovering.

Ruby used her quantum shard to cast *Detect Magic*. She confirmed the doll’s magic—and the hum dust’s—were completely gone.

Nickolas, having seen there was no danger, had already gone back to sleep.

Ruby continued experimenting and shared her thoughts: the dolls didn’t use quantum magic. Her shard identified it as *Graviton*—not really a traditional school of magic, but something deeper. It appeared to interact poorly with the quantum magic of the shard and the paint.

Now, she also noticed the hum dust had reacted differently—it held magic she identified as *Entropy*.

She had now encountered three unfamiliar "flavors" of magic: **Quantum**, **Graviton**, and **Entropy**—none of which she had heard of before.

### Almost to Westruun

The group continued traveling. The endless grass fields gave way to pine forest: the Bramblewood Forest, a vast woodland encircling Westruun. They began seeing more traffic—lumberjacks, loggers, and farmers heading to large fields. Many asked about the strange star or the supposed sky ship.

From passing Pale Guards—Westruun’s official army—they learned the star was actually *The Brown Beacon*, a skyship captained by Elowen Blythe. She was described as pragmatic and profit-driven. But no one knew why the ship was so bright or why it had been hovering for several days.

### Ambush?

A day’s travel from Westruun, they noticed *The Brown Beacon* wasn’t hovering above the city, but over the forest to their left. Just then, they heard the breaking of branches and rustling of leaves—something rushing toward them.

Everyone prepared—axes ignited, bows drawn, mage armor cast. But from the woods burst two elite-looking Pale Guards, bloodied and escorting a severely wounded lumberjack.

The guards, recognizing the party’s readiness, immediately ordered them—by command of Margrave Lysandra Kallos—to assist in rescuing the rest of their unit, still fighting in the forest.

Abokar, recognizing them as genuine, rushed ahead. Idris, Ruby, and Nickolas asked questions, to which the guards urgently explained: the forest itself was hostile. They had been sent to investigate when the *trees* attacked.

One guard, unwilling to wait longer, turned and ran back toward the battle. Bram Gulley from the caravan joined them. Nickolas stayed behind with Tilda to tend the injured logger.

### A Very Angry Tree

The group followed the guards into the forest. Along the way, the guards explained that a massive tree decimated their unit. They brought the logger for his forestry expertise.

But words weren't necessary.

Suddenly, the pine forest gave way to jungle—massive leaves, humid air, moonlight shining from no discernible source, even in places that should be in shadow.

They hacked through jungle undergrowth until they saw two Pale Guards thrown overhead—dead.

They arrived just in time to fight a massive treant. Three soldiers already lay dead, one barely clinging to life. With quick healing, the survivor was saved, and the party brought down the glowing-eyed treant before it could summon others.

### A Startling Discovery

After the fight, Abokar and Bram helped gather the fallen soldiers. The captain refused to leave them behind.

Ruby, scouting the perimeter, noticed something strange: she was walking on a large, flat plank, overgrown with jungle flora. Looking around, she realized a “boulder” was actually curved wood—planks of a ship.

She shouted to the others that she’d found a *ship* buried in the jungle.

Perplexed, the group and guards followed and indeed found what looked like a ship, far from any ocean.

Idris climbed up and spotted sails and a mast. Ruby, examining the wood, grew pale—it came from her homeland, Xhorhas.

Once she climbed up, she recognized the design. This was one of the rare military skyships built by the Krynn Dynasty—for speed.

She kept this quiet from the guards. As Idris found a hatch leading below, Abokar cracked it open with Betty.

As Idris descended into the darkness, Ruby quietly told Abokar:

> “I think... this might be a ship of the Aurora Watch.”

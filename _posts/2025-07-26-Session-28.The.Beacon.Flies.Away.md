## **Session 28: The Beacon Flies Off**

### A Flashback of Research

Nickolas and Viola remained behind with the caravan, keeping watch alongside Garron, Dalia, Tilda, and Tobin.  
Viola found herself reflecting on the past few days of travel, poring over the research notes of Arnaud and later Halen Greystone.

The earliest pages recounted Arnaud's growing concerns about the strange behavior of the Pluntard family over the years, culminating in his final decision regarding Viola. Seeing everything written down, it became clear Arnaud had tried to document how the family's magical talents—originally used with noble intentions—had ended up causing harm to those around them. 

Strangely, Pluntard family members began to show signs of erratic behavior and eventual madness. Toward the end of the records, some family members and close companions were dying slowly, bleeding from the eyes and ears over several weeks. Arnaud’s notes gradually shifted from blaming the magic itself to suspecting an external influence at play.

When Viola reached the point where Halen joined the research, she noticed that his role was often to answer Arnaud’s questions and offer supporting evidence. Yet Halen frequently veered off-track, compiling a long list of magical and non-magical illnesses, curses, rot, and corruptive substances. The notes felt like an ongoing exchange of letters—passing research back and forth rather than collaborating side-by-side.

Halen’s tangents often explored strange pigments and colors he could extract—or couldn't. Arnaud focused more on the symptoms and impacts of the illnesses themselves.

One illness eventually caught Viola’s attention—"Blood Fever." Marked prominently in the pages, it was described by Halen as a condition that temporarily boosted intelligence while causing chaos and madness. Victims would bleed from their eyes and eventually succumb to an extremely high fever.

Further along in the notes, they referenced a similar condition called **Typhros**, said to affect only the nobility of the Krynn Dynasty. Though seemingly a well-kept secret, Halen had recovered old letters from citizens describing the queen bleeding light and blood from their eyes while behaving erratically.

The final entries suggested that what they were observing might not be a disease or curse, but rather a bodily rejection—too much of something overwhelming the body, manifesting in similar symptoms.

### Investigating the Ship

Meanwhile, Idris descended into the dark hold of a small airship, stranded in what was once a forest but now resembled a jungle. Below deck, he found broken crates and barrels—one of which contained surprisingly fresh beer from Xhorhas, indicating the ship hadn’t been there long despite the encroaching vines.

Ruby joined the search and discovered four hammocks. There were no signs of a struggle. The ship hadn’t crashed—it had simply been... left behind.

Back on the deck, Ruby's memories of the ship sharpened. She noticed a missing arcane core from the pedestal that normally powered flight. Curious, she retrieved the Quantum Shard and placed it into the socket without any reaction. Suddenly A blinding flash of light erupted from above them.

### Strange Movements of the Brown Beacon

That light caught Abokar’s attention. High above, the **Brown Beacon**, a skyship that had previously hovered motionless above the forest, was suddenly moving erratically—zigzagging and rotating before abruptly accelerating toward them.

Then it happened.

The Beacon straightened out and shot forward like a blazing comet. Its light flared like a second sun as it descended lower and faster than ever before. Abokar's backpack began shaking violently. Before he could react, the **doll** he’d bought from the TumbleToys merchant days ago burst out and launched into the sky.

At the same time, the vial containing a sample of **EternaYouth** aged instantly—its contents crumbling into dust.

The Beacon roared overhead. Everyone was forced to shield their eyes from the blinding brilliance. Around them, the jungle exploded with growth, twisting the terrain into something nearly unrecognizable and impassable.

### A Cat Stuck in a Tree

Below deck, Idris had hidden in the sleeping chambers, his backpack vibrating ominously. Before he could react, vines erupted from the backpack, wrapping around him. He cried out—alerting the others.

Rushing to help, the group faced a **shambling mound**, a sentient mass of vines and roots, lashing out and trying to devour them. After a fierce fight of steel, spell, and will, they brought the creature down.

In the aftermath, Idris recovered most of his belongings—except for a **quantum branch** he had once collected from the great tree beside the goblin fortress. It had vanished.


### A Body Falls From the Sky

Back with the caravan, Nickolas and Viola used the brief moment they had to push the cart and horses into cover beneath the trees. They watched in awe and dread as the Brown Beacon raced overhead at breakneck speed toward the fields beyond.

As the shockwave passed, the landscape morphed. Pines twisted into massive jungle trees, thick with vines and broad leaves. Then, without warning, something crashed nearby.

A corpse lay on the ground, clad in strange, exotic armor. Viola and Nickolas investigated, but found no identifying items—only that it was a human male, dead from multiple stab wounds, likely inflicted *before* the fall.

### Interrogating the Corpse

Guided by the eagle spirit Viola had summoned, the rest of the group carved their way back through the jungle to the caravan. When they regrouped, they shared stories—and gathered around the fallen body.

Ruby went pale. She recognized the armor: **Aurora Watch.** Someone had been hunting her for years. She tried to sneak away but stayed close enough to listen.

Idris used his mystic abilities to commune with the dead, asking three questions:

**"What were you doing on the ship?"**  
> *Mutiny. I tried to stop a war between the Dynasty and Tal'Dorei, but failed. Taskhand Verin Thelyss went mad after going blind. He stole the ship.*

**"Why were you here?"**  
> *We were hunting the traitor Ruby Krynn. She stole a Divine Beacon from the Dynasty. She betrayed the Queen.*

**"Why did you steal the ship?"**  
> *We believe the Divine Beacon is aboard. We can feel it. It belongs to us—it was stolen, and we are reclaiming it.*

### Ruby Tries to Run

Hearing this, Ruby attempted to slip away quietly, fearing how both the Pale Guards from Westruun and her companions might react. But she was spotted.

Instead of hostility or interrogation, her companions simply... talked to her. No threats. No chains. Just questions. Perhaps this *wasn’t* the Ruby the Aurora Watch sought. Or maybe she was being framed.

Then the Pale Guard captain stepped in.

He confirmed that the Aurora Watch had indeed been in the city—asking questions, hunting Ruby—until the Brown Beacon returned. After that, they suddenly claimed Ruby Krynn was dead and began frequent meetings with the **Margrave** and the captain of the Beacon.

## **Session 29: Westruun**

### The Last Few Hours to Westruun

The final stretch toward Westruun was marked by tense conversations. Ruby revealed a secret that stunned the group—she was not just any traveler, but a princess of the Krynn Dynasty, daughter of the Bright Queen herself. The revelation cast a long shadow over the day’s march, and talk turned to the Aurora Watch.

Viola pressed Captain Varen Myrick to understand that the presence of a few Aurora Watch soldiers should not condemn the entire Dynasty. Varen, wary but pragmatic, eventually struck a deal with Garron: he would personally escort the body of the fallen Aurora Watch member back to Westruun at speed, where he could report directly to the Margrave.

### Arrival at the Gates

The Silvercut Road carried them across the sweeping plains until the walls of Westruun rose into view—vast, scarred from old wars, but unyielding. Rows of Pale Guards in gleaming armor flanked the gates, scrutinizing travelers under the fluttering banners of the Margrave. The crowd waiting to enter murmured uneasily. Whispers of the Brown Beacon spread like wildfire—of how it had hovered for days above the Bramblewood before vanishing in a burst of unnatural speed.

The group waited among the restless throng as the guards checked wagons and merchants with sharp efficiency. Abokar quickly noted the signs of a double shift, the soldiers tense and weary. Among the usual merchants, a few hawkers darted through the line, selling cheap trinkets.

One of them caught Viola’s eye. Despite her efforts to ward him off, the human peddler—with a wide grin, long leather coat, and swaggering gait—strode directly toward her. His sales pitch never finished. With a single, resounding crack, Viola’s walking stick dropped him unconscious.  

The guards looked on with thinly veiled satisfaction. Varen barked an order, and the soldiers cleared the way. The unconscious hawker was dragged aside, and the captain led the party swiftly through the gates and into the city.

### Through the Market and the Opal Ward

The city opened before them in a wash of noise and color. Narrow alleys gave way to crowded squares where merchants shouted above the clamor, carts rolled heavy with goods, and children darted through the press of bodies. Yet beneath the bustle lay an unmistakable tension. Guards patrolled everywhere, and conversations hushed whenever armor clattered past.

The party crossed a sea of stalls—silks from Ank’Harel, spices from Syngorn, barrels of salted fish from Foramere. At the square’s heart loomed the **Exandrian Exchange**, a grand marble hall where rare goods were auctioned off. A crowd had gathered, shouting bids as merchants presented their wares. Idris eyed the shops for a new backpack, but Varen urged them onward toward the Opal Ward and the Hall of Reason.

On the way, they passed a black statue towering in the square: **The Black King**, a legendary guardian said to awaken in Westruun’s darkest hours. Varen admitted he had never seen it stir—not even during the Chroma Conclave’s assault, when dragons sought to dominate all of Tal’Dorei. The scars of that war still marked the city walls.

### The Hall of Reason

The Hall of Reason stood in quiet authority, its corridors lined with statues. Guards carried the body of the Aurora Watch soldier as Varen led the group past the main doors and into a side chamber. As they walked, the air thickened—the truth-compelling weight of a **Zone of Truth** pressed upon them. The magic here was permanent, woven deep into the hall itself.

### Margrave Lysandra and Captain Blyght

Inside, two women were deep in discussion. The first, regal and composed despite weary eyes, was **Lysandra Kallos**, Margrave of Westruun. She wore a dark blue gown and a silver chain bearing the sigil of the Tal’Dorei Council.  

The second, sharp and furious, was **Captain Elowen Blyght**. Short black hair framed a face twisted in anger, her leather coat adorned with a worn compass. She bristled the moment the group entered, demanding answers about her missing ship.

Varen began his report, aided by the adventurers, recounting the events in the Bramblewood.

### The Source of Light

Viola turned her questions toward Blyght. She quickly deduced that the captain’s anger came not only from her ship’s theft but from her ability to **lie** within the Hall—a feat that should have been impossible. When Viola pointed this out, Lysandra ordered Blyght escorted outside, then brought back in. This time, the magic held.  

Under truth’s weight, Blyght admitted that half a year ago she purchased a strange crystal in Kraghammer from a dwarf named **Jorlan Herr**, a dealer in “oddities from the deep.” With the help of **Fizzlebang**, an eccentric but powerful wizard of Westruun, she had built a containment cage for it. The crystal became a power source, enabling her ship—the Brown Beacon—to fly faster and higher than any other. It was this light that had made the ship so infamous.

### The Aurora Watch

Further revelations followed. Taskhand **Verin Thelyss** of the Aurora Watch had met Lysandra several times in pursuit of Ruby Krynn, whom they accused of stealing a Luxon Beacon. But when the Brown Beacon arrived in Westruun, they abruptly claimed Ruby was already dead. Their attention shifted to acquiring Blyght’s ship.  

Then, weeks later, disaster struck. Verin went blind after an alchemical accident. He refused magical healing and soon grew aggressive. His negotiations soured into threats—until at last he stole the Brown Beacon outright.  

The theft left Westruun facing a political nightmare, one that could ignite war between Tal’Dorei and the Dynasty. The Aurora Watch had even been gifted a small mansion in the city as part of diplomatic outreach, making matters worse.

### The Sabotage

Why had no one pursued the Beacon when it hovered above the Bramblewood? Lysandra grimly explained: Westruun’s own skyships had been **sabotaged**. Guards had been subdued, not killed, but the ships were crippled beyond use. The act had required precision, numbers, and inside knowledge.  

Magic could have been another path, but Westruun had few spellcasters capable of such feats. Fizzlebang himself, though powerful, claimed he was not “part of Westruun”—rather, the city had grown around his tower. The party urged Lysandra to summon him regardless, and to confirm his true identity under the Zone of Truth. The mention of doppelgangers gave the Margrave pause, a flicker of panic breaking through her composure.

### The Cobalt Soul

The conversation turned to the **Cobalt Soul**, Westruun’s great library and academy. The order dedicated itself to knowledge and the containment of dangerous magic. Lysandra explained that access was restricted, but she could provide a letter to the **High Curator Yudala Fon**, granting the group a chance at deeper research within the archives.

### A New Mission for Agent Adastra

At this point, Lysandra recognized Nickolas. She addressed him as an **Agent of the Council of Tal’Dorei**. Asked about his prior mission, Nickolas reported on his investigations into Kymal’s drug trade and confirmed the matter resolved.  

Lysandra immediately assigned him a new task: recover the Brown Beacon and return it to Westruun. The ship was vital to the city’s trade and security. She promised the city’s resources—within reason—and began with a payment of fifty gold pieces for each party member.

### The Saddled Plainscow

Leaving the Hall, the group scattered briefly. Abokar, ravenous, followed the sounds of laughter and clinking mugs to a tavern called **The Saddled Plainscow**. Though high-end by appearance, the inside was thick with pipe smoke and noise. The half-orc innkeeper, scarred and sharp-eyed with a broken tusk, served drinks without ceremony, barking for patrons to fetch their own from the counter.

Abokar and Idris went inside, while Viola lingered outside and Nickolas accompanied Ruby toward the Temple Ward.

Inside the tavern, Idris eavesdropped and overheard a rumor: the famed **EternaYouth** cream was no longer being made. The fountain that produced its key water had mysteriously dried up two weeks ago, leaving the alchemist unable to craft more. The news greatly distressed many of Westruun’s citizens.

### The Temple of the Platinum Dragon

Ruby and Nickolas made their way to the **Temple of the Platinum Dragon**, a fortress-like marble sanctuary gleaming with platinum tiles. Inside, white flames burned eternally, casting light on murals of Bahamut’s seven avatars. Pilgrims paid gold coins for vials of the holy water flowing from its central fountain.

Ruby pleaded for help to cure the aging curse inflicted by a ghost. The priest agreed it was possible—but only with rare components and powerful magic worth **800 gold**. Ruby insisted she had aided another Platinum Dragon temple, beneath the Silvercut Crossroads, but the priest dismissed her claim as blasphemy. Outraged, Ruby stormed out.

### The Temple of Three Lights

Next, they entered the **Temple of the Three Lights**, crowned with three spires glowing red-gold, soft orange, and blue-white—each representing the Dawnfather, the Everlight, and the Lawbearer. Inside, the colors blended into a single shifting glow over a central fountain.

Here too, miracles came at a price. The priests debated Ruby’s case seriously, suggesting that if more than a day had passed, even *Greater Restoration* might fail. But perhaps if the three of them combined their power, success was possible. Still, the price was steep.  

Ruby pulled aside the priest who understood her affliction, urging him to attempt the ritual alone with her enhancements. But he refused—too wary of dangerous magic, especially within the sanctity of the temple.

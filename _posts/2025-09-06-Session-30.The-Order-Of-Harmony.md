## **Session 30: The Order of Harmony**

### Harmony in the Opal Ward

While Abokar and Idris were inside the Saddled Plainscow, and Nickolas had accompanied Ruby into the Temple Ward to seek healing, Viola sat on a bench outside the tavern, people-watching.

That was when she noticed them.

A procession in simple white robes drifted through the street, blindfolds tied over calm, smiling faces. They were led by two men in white, their garments stitched with a perfect diamond pattern. The pair walked in perfect unison, their expressions blank, steps matched as though pulled by the same invisible string.

Viola asked a passerby who they were and was warned to steer clear—“The Order of Harmony,” the man muttered. “New acolytes.” Before he could elaborate, Viola was already striding toward the leaders with a breezy smile and a pitch about music and gigs.

The two men stopped. They turned their heads at precisely the same angle, at precisely the same time.

“Viola… Pluntard.”

“Why were you hidden? What truths do you know from within the tree?”

The words struck like cold water. She kept her face composed, but their knowledge rattled her. There was a delay to their speech, a strange echo—not in sound, but in feeling—as if a hundred unseen eyes were peering through theirs.

“Tell us what you know,” they continued in the same simultaneous cadence. “We hear. We share. We are.”

Viola bluffed, gliding past their questions. They pressed on, inviting her to join them and “remember what was forgotten.” One of them slipped her an address to a house somewhere in the city.

A prickle climbed Viola’s spine. Their manner—the mirrored tone, the synchronized poise—stirred memories of people who had steeped too long in Pluntard magic, worn thin until they moved and spoke alike.

Some of the blindfolded acolytes began to shift restlessly. The two men immediately turned to soothe them and guide them away. And as they did, two other missionaries had somehow appeared behind Viola, different faces but the same flawless tone and timing.

“Become part of us,” they intoned. “Let go of your troubles. We can guide you.”

Viola backed away, outwardly unflustered, inwardly deeply disturbed.

### Abokar and Idris

Inside, Abokar finished his meal and glanced over to find Idris slumped over the table, having drunk himself unconscious. With a rueful sigh, Abokar shouldered Idris and let his thoughts drift to the source of his own growing power—the Patron in the dark between moments.

In the quiet place behind his eyes, answers came like instructions written in smoke: alchemical rites, rare components, the delicate steps to pull a soul back across the threshold. If he dared perform such a rite, the Patron would be… closer.

Abokar blinked and the vision faded. He carried Idris to an inn, secured three rooms, and left a neat note: Gone to check the Aurora Watch house.

### Ruby and Nickolas

Frustrated by the temples’ transactional approach to miracles, Ruby was stopped short when Nickolas pointed out Tilda quietly shepherding Dalia Vos into a narrow side entrance between larger sanctuaries—a modest stairwell descending beneath a sign of the Everlight.

They followed into a small, quiet chapel. A handful of people prayed in the pews. Tilda spoke gently with a thin half-elf woman with silver-gray hair and a simple white gown threaded with gold filaments.

“Seraphine Liora,” she introduced herself, head priestess of this humble temple to the Everlight. “I do not heal by command. I guide those willing through longer rites—time and grace instead of coin and reagents.”

She explained that where other temples demanded costly components, the Everlight’s path offered reflection, compassion, and the chance to be tested. She invited Ruby to join the ritual and, at Ruby’s hopeful glance toward Nickolas, urged him to stay; the presence of friends could help.

Others would take part: an older man with a freshly broken leg, his wife keeping vigil with bread and water; a young woman with heavy burn scars, her mother quiet and red-eyed; and a soldier whose right arm hung useless at his side, his brother in full kit teasing him with wine about having fallen off the wall after a startling bright streak across the sky earlier that day.

### The Ritual

As candles were set and chalk lines drawn, Ruby suggested using a special material to aid the rite. Seraphine listened, intrigued, but declined for now. “Not here, not today,” she said gently. “My focus is on these souls—not experiments—and certainly not within this temple. Perhaps another time, outside.”

The ritual began and stretched across slow hours. Ruby’s mind slipped into a warm, gold-lit hush.

She opened her eyes in a younger body, dressed in familiar, comfortable clothes, standing in a darkness that brightened with patient light. Three figures took shape before her:

Essek, her brother, smiling with cruel amusement, holding a Luxon Beacon that pulsed like a heartbeat. “You want vengeance,” he purred. “You know I took everything. This is where you begin to take it back.”

Her mother, Leylas, eyes blazing and rimmed with light and blood—Typhros burning in her gaze. “You are my shame,” she snarled. “You will never be anything but a curse.”

And a soldier, bleeding out on the floorboards—the first Aurora Watch she had killed when she ran. “Help… Please. I did nothing to you. I was only following orders. Following orders.”

Ruby stepped past the Beacon and the fury and knelt beside the soldier.

Golden light gathered and a voice rose, kind and steady. The Everlight does not count coins. She counts chances. You chose compassion, where nothing could be gained. Walk on in my light.

Ruby’s eyes opened to the chapel. Warmth washed through her bones. The gray of the ghost’s touch receded; youth returned by slow degrees. Dalia, not far from her, also exhaled a shuddering breath and smiled, memories of the ambush already blurring in the light.

Not all left healed—the older man still limped—but hope felt tangible in the quiet that followed.

### Scouting the Aurora Watch House

Viola met Abokar and shared her unsettling encounter with the Order of Harmony. On their way through the Opal Ward, they noticed fresh pamphlets for the Order pasted to lampposts.

The Aurora Watch residence stood in a quieter street with walled gardens and tidy paths. Even from the corner, something felt… wrong. No birdsong. No footsteps. They had seen no one for two streets, though the distant clatter of Westruun still drifted faintly—carts, horses, a smith’s hammer. The silence was only here, pressed close to this place.

Viola shifted into a hound and instantly fought the urge to bolt. The soil stank of damp decay—not strong enough for a human nose, but unmistakable in this shape. They retreated to knock on nearby doors first.

At the first house, locks slid, chains clicked, and an old woman opened the door a crack. Thin, bent, a black headband pulled tight, her hand trembled on the chain.

“Yeeess?” she asked.

Abokar explained they were investigating the house next door. She immediately complained about the “dark-skinned elves,” saying the guards had told her they were foreign ambassadors, but she hadn’t trusted them. Since they’d arrived, her flowers had withered; she had even buried her pet bird. She warned them to stay away—especially after one of the elves “had that accident and went blind.” Things had been “nasty” ever since.

At the next house, two fresh graves marked “Toby” and “Filou” lay in the garden. A halfling with a forced cheerfulness and hollow eyes opened the door. He admitted he’d buried his dogs after they sickened and wouldn’t stop barking. He spoke more kindly of the Aurora Watch, saying they’d been friendly at first—especially their leader. But a week or two ago, the leader was blinded in an accident and grew cold and distant afterward. He added that the mansion had partially burned long ago; the city repaired most of it, though some outbuildings remained damaged. Recently, the current tenants had begun repairs, ordering lumber and tools—shovels, hammers, pickaxes. Strangely he'd been hearing strange screams occasionally from there now, it chills him.

### Whoo-hooo

Abokar and Viola turned back toward the Opal Ward to gather the others. As they regrouped, a rising hum cut through the evening.

An ancient gnome with wild white hair blazed past on a hovering metal disk. “It wooorkkkssss! IT FINALLY WOOOORKS! Whaaahooooo!” he whooped, spinning down the street.

Viola flicked a magic stone and clipped the gnome square in the hear. “OUCH!” he yelped, pinwheeling before righting himself. He looked around, scandalized. “LOOK OUT! SOMEONE IS THROWING ROCKS!”

The party shouted that perhaps he should test outside the city. He blinked, then brightened. “OH! YOU’RE RIGHT.” He slapped the disk. “YAAAHOOOO!” In a heartbeat, he arced skyward and vanished beyond the roofs. Moments later, fireworks popped in the distance.

“Fizzlebang?” someone guessed.

### Approaching the House

With the city lighting its evening torches, the party returned to the Aurora Watch residence. The neighboring lanes glowed warm with lamplight and conversation—but no one walked this street. Darkness pooled here, undisturbed, as if the night refused to thin.

The closer they came, the more the ordinary sounds of Westruun dimmed, as though heard through thick glass. A draft slid along their collars though the air was still. Breath misted once, then didn’t, a trick of cold that wasn’t there.

A narrow cobblestone path led to the front door. Dry leaves lay scattered across it and did not stir, though wind worried the hedges. Shadows clung to the eaves in stubborn knots.

The garden earth had the flat, dead smell of drowned embers. Shrubs curled inward on themselves. Where moonlight touched the front windows, the glass looked muddied from within, as if something had exhaled across it and not wiped the breath away.

They circled to the back. The burned-out outbuildings slouched against one another like tired men, black ribs of char showing through half-hearted repairs. A few panes in the main house were veiled in grime, and behind them—no candlelight, no movement. Only the sense of a house holding its breath, listening.

Something was wrong here. Not witchcraft they recognized, not a curse they could name—just that fine, hair-raising wrongness that makes the body want to turn away before the mind understands why.

They stood in the hush a moment longer, the city’s noise a distant rumor, the moonlight a little too thin, and then looked to one another.

Whatever waited inside was not natural. And it was waiting.

## **Session 31: The Aurora Watch Villa**

### Investigating the Outside

The group circled the old villa, its rear walls scorched and never fully repaired. The windows were impossible to see through—muddied from within, as though frost had claimed them long ago and never melted.

A sudden crack of a branch startled them. Idris emerged from the darkness, bleary-eyed, having followed Abokar’s note to the address. The relief of reunion faded quickly; the unease of this place swallowed it whole.

Every few seconds, their breaths misted—then stopped—then misted again. The pattern was wrong, unnatural. The air carried no wind, yet the hairs on their necks prickled as though something unseen moved through it.

Idris called upon the spirits for guidance. Spectral ravens—pale and half-formed—flocked around him in a vision so vivid he gagged and fell to his knees, bile rising from the chill that clung to their wings.

Ruby drew out the Quantum Shard and reached through it to sense the Weave. Beneath their feet, the ground pulsed with necromantic energy—strong, then weak again, in a slow rhythm like waves breaking against a distant shore.

### Going Inside

Abokar, with a grim set to his jaw, seized the door handle. It was unlocked. Even through his glove, he felt the metal’s unnatural cold bite to the bone. When the door swung open, a breath of stale air rolled out.

Viola—shapeshifted as a wolf—darted inside first, nostrils flaring. The entry hall was plain and silent: one thick support pillar, three doors leading elsewhere. The forward door looked recently reinforced with metal bands. The others, left and right, were older—weathered wood with time-silvered hinges.

The wolf bristled, muscles tight against the instinct to flee. Every fiber of her animal body screamed to turn and run, but she forced herself to stay.

### The Left Room

Behind the left door lay a small chamber once meant for storage, now a crude sleeping space with two bunk beds. Viola pawed at the floor until Abokar joined her, prying up a loose tile with his crowbar. Beneath it, a small chest waited—coins and a rolled parchment within.

They unrolled the note, reading in silence:

> *In exchange for re-opening the Underwalk, the Clasp will deliver strategic knowledge about the energy source of the Brown Beacon.*  
> *Signed: Verin Thelyss – Aurora Watch*  
> *Signed: Soren Telv – Clasp*

### The Right Room

The right-hand door opened into a sitting room. A table slumped in the center, surrounded by chairs that had once been comfortable, now hollowed by age. The air carried that same biting cold. Ruby, irritated, knelt at the hearth to coax life into the logs already stacked there.

Flame caught—and immediately she noticed the rhythm. The fire brightened and dimmed in the same slow pulse as the necromantic energy beneath the villa.

Idris entered just in time to see the edges of parchment curling in the flame. “Stop!” he barked. He stamped out the fire while Ruby protested, realizing too late that she’d nearly destroyed evidence. They salvaged a fragment, half-burned and fragile:

> Enxxxxx xron Aether  
> Proxxxxxx xxmund Adasxxx  
> xundamental Spheres

### The Back Room

Abokar pressed on. The next door revealed a storage space where everything was rotting or mold-choked. Two more doors waited—one to the left, one to the right. The back wall looked newly rebuilt, unlike the rest of the decaying structure.

The left door led into a barn, heavy with the scent of death. Old hay, brittle underfoot. Scattered bones. When Abokar turned to leave, a dry rattle echoed from within—like branches striking one another. He spun back and charged inside.

Silence. Then, the clatter of bones like teeth grinding.

From the piles of decay, skeletons knit themselves together—two great hounds of bone, and above them, flocks of undead ravens taking form in the rafters.

### Undead

“Undead!” Abokar roared.

The battle erupted in tight quarters. Abokar held the doorway against the hounds, his armor shuddering under their weight. Viola, in wolf form, darted back to regroup beneath a bed. Raven swarms dove past Abokar’s shoulders, claws scraping air.

Ruby’s blade cleaved through wings and bone, sparks of necrotic energy scattering like black ash. Idris loosed arrows through the chaos while Nickolas, voice hoarse, raised his holy symbol. A wave of divine power surged out—ravens fell to dust, one hound recoiled in terror.

Working in grim unison, the party pressed forward—axe, arrow, flame, and faith—until the last echo faded and silence returned.

In that silence, the truth settled heavy in their bones: this place wasn’t merely haunted. It was corrupted.

### Playing with Forces Beyond Her

Ruby sat at the table, the burned note before her. She had seen how the Quantum Shard could collapse magic—could glimpse other realities for an instant. She wanted to use that fracture of power to read what had been lost.

The others watched as the shard began to hum. The air thickened. Time seemed to hesitate.

For one heartbeat, all sound vanished.

Then came the breaking—like glass shattering in the soul. Ruby screamed. Blood streamed from her eyes, nose, and ears as she reeled backward. The shard went dark. The note remained only half-burned, but the air around it throbbed with the echo of something vast and disapproving.

When the moment passed, Ruby was left gasping, her face slick with blood. Whatever she had touched had looked back.

### The Cold Fire

In the back room, Abokar opened the last unopened door. Beyond it lay a kitchen, rimed with frost. Viola padded in first and slipped—ice spread across the floor in a glassy sheet.

At the far wall burned a fire—blue and cold. It pulsed in that same tide as the necromantic rhythm below their feet. Idris, in the name of experimentation, stuck a finger through the flame and hissed as frostbite bit deep. Ruby confirmed what they already sensed: the flame and the ground shared the same heartbeat.

They extinguished it with magic. Moments later, it flared back to life. They drowned it with a bucket of water—the water froze solid in seconds. The fire burned on, unbothered, blooming directly from the stone itself.

### The Hidden Passage

Something caught Abokar’s eye. An old bookcase, repurposed for pots and pans, leaned against the far wall. He tried to move it—no give. Bolted, perhaps.

He chose another method.

With two sharp swings of his axe, the bookcase splintered apart, revealing a gap behind it. Viola, still in wolf form, squeezed through first. The others followed, stepping into a chamber blackened by fire—collapsed roof, broken barrels, half-burned furniture.

Ash blanketed everything. Old footprints marked the floor. Even beneath the ice of the kitchen, traces of ash had gathered.

Viola gave a low, uneasy whine. The others turned toward her and saw what she’d found:  
a hatch, half-hidden beneath the soot, leading down into the dark.

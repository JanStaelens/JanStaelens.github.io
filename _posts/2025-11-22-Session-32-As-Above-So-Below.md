## **Session 32: As Above So Below**

### The Long Way Down

Abokar unlatched the hatch, and a dense fog of frost rolled out across his boots. Beneath it, a mineshaft yawned open—thirty, maybe forty feet of frozen wood and iron descending into darkness. Ruby whispered a spell, and her dancing lights drifted downward like drifting stars, scattering kaleidoscopic reflections across the ice-rimed beams.

They chose to split up. Abokar began his careful descent with Viola—shrunken into her cat form—balanced lightly across his broad shoulders. Idris tried to follow, but a slick patch sent him tumbling down the ladder, bouncing to a heap on the floor far below. Ruby and Nickolas remained above for a moment longer, their breaths misting as they peered into the depths.

Below, the space widened into what might once have been a basement. A wall to their left radiated a biting cold so intense it blackened the air around it; even stepping too close sent necrotic pain crawling up their limbs. Ahead, a hewn corridor of strange craftsmanship extended into deeper shadow.

Abokar crouched beside a support beam, fingertips brushing its surface. The wood was ancient—withered, rotten—but the cut of the tunnel itself was… modern. Wrong. As though someone had carved new paths through a place that should have been left buried.

Realizing the tunnels stretched far, he called up to Ruby and Nickolas. With careful footing and muttered curses, they descended the icy steps and joined the others below.

### The Pit

They pressed on. Soon an opening appeared to their left—wide, black, impossibly deep. Ruby drifted her lights down into the void. They fell and fell…and still no bottom revealed itself.

A quiet *splash* echoed up toward them.

Another.

Then a faint scraping—bone on stone.

Idris, relentless in curiosity, anchored his gear and climbed down until the lights above began to flicker at the end of their reach. Far below, in that dim radius of failing illumination, he saw them: hundreds of animated skeletons, churning over one another in a ceaseless effort to climb the sheer walls. They slipped, fell, shattered, reformed, and plunged again into the unseen waters below.

He scrambled back up the wall, breath sharp and tight, and stammered out what he had witnessed. The group listened in uneasy silence.

### The Dungeon

The further they walked, the more the tunnel seemed to shift—modern mining gave way to old stone, dusty support beams, and the unmistakable geometry of a prison corridor. The air warmed slightly, though it did nothing to shake the dread.

Abokar jerked backward with a startled oath as skeletal hands shot through the bars of an iron cell door, clawing blindly at the air. The skeletons were trapped, but determined. Abokar and Ruby dispatched them quickly, bone fragments clattering across the floor like brittle ice.

Nickolas knelt to inspect the cell, noticing manacles half-buried under dust. Viola, still a nimble cat, slipped through the bars, seized the shackles in her teeth, and dragged them to him—adding to the odd little collection he’d started on this journey.

### Something Moves Under the Cloth

The air shifted again—sharp, crisp, winter-cold in an instant. Their breath thickened as they stepped into a wide natural cave. Frost mist curled over the ground in ghostly sheets. At the far end knelt a corpse, newly dead by the look of it, shackled on bent knees and facing a towering shape draped in tattered cloth.

The cloth moved—not from wind, for there was none, but as if something beneath it breathed. Slowly. Deeply.

Viola padded forward, only to be violently forced out of her cat form as a wave of pain crashed through her. Abokar staggered back with a curse, barely escaping the same aura. One by one, the group positioned themselves just outside the invisible boundary of whatever malevolent force radiated from that shrouded mass.

The air tasted wrong—sour, metallic, unholy. Their skin crawled. The cave itself seemed to recoil from their presence.

Then the sound came.

A low, gutteral rasp—like something attempting to speak with a throat not made for speech. Beneath the cloth, hands—unnaturally long, painfully thin—pressed outward and clawed at the covering. They pulled, strained, but the cloth refused to fall, bound taut at the top of what might have been a cage.

Something was alive under there.

Or something that still believed it was.

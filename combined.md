## Tal'Dorei - Exandria - Kymal, 991 PD

Greetings, Brave Souls,

As you walk the cobbled streets of Kymal, the city's life buzzes around you, filled with the sounds and smells of a place brimming with stories. You're on your way to meet Lord Halen Greystone at his manor, a path that feels both new and strangely familiar. You can't help but think back to the series of events that brought you here.

It all started with a seemingly random decision to come to Kymal. Yet, as you ponder it, you realize it wasn't as random as it seemed. There was a pull, an unseen force, maybe curiosity or fate, that drew you to this city. It's funny how life works, guiding you to places you never expected to be.

Then there's the matter of your past adventures. You've done quite a bit in your time, enough to build a reputation that apparently reached Lord Greystone. It makes you wonder which particular deed caught his attention.

And of course, you're not alone in your journey. Along the way, you've met fellow travelers who've become companions, friends. You've shared adventures and faced dangers together, creating bonds that are hard to break. You wonder who among them has been involved in the stories that have made you interesting to a noble like Lord Greystone.

As you continue walking, your mind is a whirl of thoughts and memories, piecing together the journey that has led you to this moment. It's a simple story, really, but it's yours, filled with the choices you've made and the people you've met along the way. And now, as you approach Lord Greystone's manor, holding his invitation letter that was directed at you, you're ready to add another chapter.

You can't help but wonder... what's this guy's problem with 'painting supplies' of all things that needs your specific skillset?

# Persoonlijke noot

Dag vrienden,

Zoals jullie weten, is onze vorige campagne op een mooie manier ten einde gekomen. Nogmaals dank aan de DM voor het vele werk en de leuke sessies. Bij deze neem ik de toorts over voor de volgende campagne. Een Homebrew binnen Tal'Dorei in de wereld van Exandria, zoals gecreÃ«erd bij Critical Role. Let op dat je niet volledig moet vertrouwen op alles uit de show, als je die kent. Ik (en jullie) zullen deze wereld tot de onze maken.

Voor jullie character backstories mogen jullie zo ver (of niet) gaan als jullie zelf willen. De enige drie vragen die ik zou aanraden dat iedereen ten minste doorloopt voor zijn karakter zijn:

- Waarom was mijn personage al in en rond Kymal?
- Welke van mijn vorige avonturen en acties zouden mogelijk opgemerkt kunnen zijn door de adel van deze stad?
- Ken ik al iemand anders zijn personage uit de spelersgroep en hoe? (dit is niet verplicht, maar kan leuk zijn).

Als jullie personages maken, met alle 'usual' stuff, stuur dan zeker een antwoord mee op die drie vragen. Dat kan jullie personage plaatsen in het verhaal.

Kymal is een middelgrote stad in het midden van Tal'Dorei, geen kuststad dus, maar eerder een oude mijnstad langs een grote bergketen. Alle metalen en edelstenen zijn ondertussen al een tijdje opgedroogd en het mijnen zelf is ondertussen iets van de vorige generatie.

## The invitation by Lord Halen Greystone

The adventure begins with an invitation letter delivered the day before to each character.

Lord Greystone is seeking a skilled team of detectives, magic users, and fighters to gather a very dangerous substance known as Hum Dust. His goals are to remove this substance from the streets, where it is being used as a dangerous drug, and to utilize it in creating a new, spectacular pigment for his main business. He is a renowned painter and merchant of pigments and paintings, with many high lords and ladies owning Greystone paintings noted for their vivid colors.

Mila, the assistant to Greystone, has collaborated with her friend Lia, the housekeeper of the manor, to select the right people for the job. They ended up inviting several individuals based on rumors and connections in the city:

- **Abokar**, a no-nonsense male dwarf and a sergeant of the city watch. He is an ex-soldier and strong warrior, known for his punctuality and precision.
- **Idris**, a laid-back and exotic male Tabaxi mystic, who claims to communicate with spirits. His involvement came recommended by Gusto, a friend of the Greystone family, after solving some complex cases in the city.
- **Nickolas**, a human male renowned for his detailed knowledge of the law. He is also a somewhat covert agent for the Council of Tal'Dorei. His reasons for being in the city are unclear, but Mila suspects his assistance could be advantageous.
- **Ruby**, an exotic human woman from the distant Xhorhas. Rumors suggest she has been exploring magic with some of the city's scholars and might possess magical capabilities herself.
- **Rono Cley**, an older gentleman who has been residing in Kymal for an unknown reason. However, rumors suggest the cause of recent 'loud bangs' in the city is due to Rono 'practicing' with his special weaponâ€”a pistol that shoots small iron balls at high speeds with devastating effects. Mila believes his wisdom and weapon skills could be protective for the group.

Additionally, at the personal request of Lord Greystone, **Lady Viola Pluntard** has also been invited. Lord Greystone mentioned he knew the late Arnoud, who often spoke of Viola. Mila suspects the invitation aims to distract her from her recent bereavement, though other motives may exist.

### Arrival at Greystone manor

Each member of the company arrived in their own style: Rono was half an hour early, enjoying the weather on a bench; Ruby arrived shortly before the required time and sought shade under a nearby tree; Nickolas stood outside the courtyard entrance for a while before entering; Abokar arrived precisely on time, marched straight to the door, and demanded immediate entry; finally, Lady Pluntard arrived in a small horse-drawn coach, waiting for the butler, Boris, to clumsily open the door and escort her into the house.

### Meeting Lord Halen Greystone

![afbeelding](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/d8ba8bea-d5f4-40b6-8e9d-22bbfcc39257)

All were introduced to Lord Greystone, who explained his recent fascination with Hum Dust and its exotic colorful properties. He offered each member 100 gold to recover a 100% pure sample, as the sample he currently possesses is unpure, rendering it useless for painting. He painted on a canvas with it, but it just looks a nasty brown. Viola and Nickolas persuaded Lord Greystone to leave the sample painting with them for further examination. He mentioned that Hum Dust must be magical in nature due to rumors of it litterly 'humming' when you listen.

### Meeting Mila and Lia

Mila, appearing to be a beautiful young human woman around 20 years old, revealed during conversations that she is actually 55 but has been using a costly anti-wrinkle cream called EternaYouth, which is extremely difficult to obtain and is shipped from Emon.

Mila indicated that the Hum Dust might be connected to the closed-off areas of the city, particularly in the poorer sections near the Muddy Boot Inn tavern. Most of this discussion was also overheard by the housekeeper Lia, although only Viola noticed Lia when she left the room and confronted her. Mila explained that she has worked with Lia for 27 years and considers her a close friend. Lia was quite shy and explained that her role is to clean discreetly without being seen or interrupting.

### Captain of the guard: Reginald Huxley

The group eventually left. Abokar first spoke with Reginald Huxley, the captain of the guards in Kymal. Reginald explained that he is unaware of the reasons behind the city's lockdowns, which are ordered directly by Calis Krishtan, the Margrave of the city. It seems Calis wishes to simply make the 'problems' disappear. There have been some deaths and strange magical occurrences in parts of the city. Calis has forbidden the captain from investigating the root causes. However, the captain hinted that the South-Goldhoard area near the Muddy Boot Inn, which is to be guarded by Wim and Mirella, a known couple within the city watch who are somewhat lax in their duties, might be accessible. If nothing is officially blocked off and someone were to 'accidentally' walk in, it wouldn't be his concern.

### Rumors at the Muddy Boot Inn

The party regrouped at the house inherited by Viola, where they got to know each other better and decided to follow Nickolas to the Muddy Boot Inn. It turns out Nickolas has been staying and working there to pay for his lodging, slowly gathering rumors from the locals and getting doted on by 'the mother' of the poor areas in Kymal, a kind tavern keeper named Lisa.

Nickolas has mostly been hearing loud discussions and conflicting information about a resurgence of Ravagers near the Silvercut Crossroads. Some caravans mentioned seeing a veritable army of goblins, while others reported smaller groups.

### Animal scouting

The party hatched a plan, and Viola combined forces with Ruby to perform a scouting mission. Ruby used her flying squirrel along with Viola's eagle to fly over the closed-off parts of the city. Meanwhile, Viola, secretly changed into a cat, followed along. They discovered one heavily cobwebbed building showing signs of ruin, and across the road, an old dilapidated mansion that housed a thin, malnourished woman.

### Investigating South-Goldhoard

The party set out to the locked-down area of the city and arrived exactly when Reginald suggested it would be a good time, finding the entrance currently unguarded. They proceeded inside and investigated the immediate area, finding no immediate magical effects. The ruined building appeared to have been destroyed by 'something' pushing parts of the walls outward, with stones and wreckage scattered on the street. Abokar decided to announce himself in an attempt to find and question the malnourished homeless lady. This triggered her attempt to escape through a window in the back, but she was delayed by Viola and Nickolas, who tried to calm her down. This was quickly failing, and she was about to run before Abokar drew his crossbow on her. Despite the dismay of most of the party, his intimidating stance worked, and the homeless lady froze up and begged for her life.


## Nederlandse Samenvatting

Het avontuur begint met een uitnodigingsbrief die gisteren aan elk personage is bezorgd.

Heer Greystone zoekt een getalenteerd team van detectives, magiÃ«rs en vechters om een gevaarlijke stof genaamd Hum Dust te verwerven. Zijn doel is om deze stof, die momenteel als drug wordt misbruikt, uit de straten te verwijderen en het potentieel ervan te onderzoeken als pigment voor zijn schilder- en handelsbedrijf, bekend om zijn levendige kleuren.

Mila, Greystone's assistente, en Lia, de huishoudster van het landhuis, hebben het team samengesteld op basis van geruchten en connecties in de stad:

- **Abokar**: Een praktische dwerg en sergeant van de stadswacht, bekend om zijn punctualiteit en precisie.
- **Idris**: Een ontspannen, exotische Tabaxi mysticus bekend om zijn communicatie met geesten, aanbevolen vanwege zijn recente successen in het oplossen van zaken.
- **Nickolas**: Een mens die goed onderlegd is in de wet en een discrete agent voor de raad van Tal'Dorei, met onbekende redenen voor zijn verblijf in de stad.
- **Ruby**: Een mysterieuze menselijke vrouw uit Xhorhas, rumoerig vanwege haar magische vermogens en interesse in magisch onderzoek.
- **Rono Cley**: Een oudere heer uit Kymal, bekend om de 'luide knallen' veroorzaakt door zijn pistool.
- **Lady Viola Pluntard**: Persoonlijk uitgenodigd door Heer Greystone, mogelijk om haar af te leiden van een recent overlijden.

Bij aankomst genoot Rono van de vroege ochtend buiten; Ruby zocht de schaduw op onder een boom; Nickolas aarzelde bij de ingang; Abokar eiste punctueel toegang; en Lady Pluntard arriveerde als laatste in een door paarden getrokken koets. Allen werden ontvangen door Boris, de dwergbutler, die hen naar binnen leidde.

Heer Greystone benadrukte zijn behoefte aan Hum Dust als pigment en bood 100 goud per persoon voor het leveren van een zuivere steekproef. Hij toonde een teleurstellend schilderij gemaakt van onzuivere monsters, dat er afschuwelijk uitzag door onzuiverheden.

Mila onthulde dat ze 55 jaar oud is, ondanks haar jeugdige uiterlijk, dankzij een anti-rimpelcrÃ¨me genaamd EternaYouth.

Mila suggereerde dat Hum Dust mogelijk verbonden is met de armere gebieden nabij de Muddy Boot Inn in Kymal. Lia, de huishoudster, was in de kamer tijdens het gesprek af maar werd alleen door Viola opgemerkt.

Abokar overlegde met Reginald Huxley, de kapitein van de wacht, die onthulde dat de afsluitingen van de stad door Margrave Calis Krishtan waren bevolen om niet gespecificeerde problemen te onderdrukken. Huxley hintte dat het bewaakte gebied South-Goldhoard bij de herberg toegankelijk kon zijn door minder waakzame bewakers, Wim en Mirella.

De groep verzamelde zich opnieuw in het geÃ«rfde huis van Viola. Nickolas, die in de Muddy Boot Inn verbleef en werkte, verzamelde inlichtingen over de Ravagers in de buurt van de Silvercut Crossroads, met tegenstrijdige berichten over hun sterkte.

Viola en Ruby verkenden de gesloten gebieden met Ruby's vliegende eekhoorn en Viola's arend. Ze observeerden een sterk met spinnenwebben bedekt ruÃ¯ne en een vervallen herenhuis bewoond door een ondervoede vrouw.

Toen het gebied tijdelijk onbewaakt was, betrad de groep het. Ze ondervonden geen onmiddellijke magische effecten, maar Ã©Ã©n van de huizen leek opzettelijk beschadigd to zijn van binnenuit. Toen ze de dakloze vrouw vonden, leidde Abokar's agressieve benadering tot een ontsnappingspoging, die door Viola en Nickolas werd vertraagd. Uiteindelijk lukte het Abokar's intimidatie en bleef de vrouw staan, maar smeekte om haar leven.

## Of Blue Smoke And Flying Cats

### The Interrogation of Joyce

The group, standing in a semi-circle around a homeless woman, began their interrogation in the quarantined area within South-Goldhoard. She said her name was Joyce and that she'd been living in that ruined mansion for a good while now. Greasing the wheels with some money, food, and a decent amount of intimidation, they discovered that another homeless person, a man by the name of Raffael, was squatting in the destroyed house across the street. Raffael used to be a smith until most of the metal from the mining tunnels started drying up. He lost his home and most of his money and has been scraping by and squatting in that abandoned house for a while. She didn't really talk much with him except to perhaps share information to help survive.

She mentioned having seen his house explode a week or so ago and the guards soon after quarantining the area. She hid and stayed because, in her own words, the lack of people made her feel safer than elsewhere in the city; she just stayed away from the other house.

It turns out Raffael often had periods of depression followed by better days, and he'd recently developed a twitch. Every week or so, a man that walked with purpose would visit Raffael for some unknown reason. The man was rather loud, walked briskly, and carried a distinct cane that had the carving of a bear on top of it. She described him as wearing a dark black cloak and usually being hooded and covering his face with a cloth. Whoever it was, he never stayed for longer than maybe 15 minutes before briskly leaving for elsewhere.

Abokar handed the woman 5 gold pieces, telling her to go stay at the Muddy Boot Inn. The woman was shocked at the amount of money and agreed to do so (it was later discovered, she did not actually go to the Inn).

### Checking out the Abandoned House

The house was filled with large cobwebs, strong enough that they could hold a brick thrown at them. So the group was agitated and on the lookout for spiders that could spin such webs.

When entering the abandoned house that Raffael was living in, Idris noticed in the back a strange blue smoke that he recognized. He mentioned to the group he saw a similar glow after a short and unfortunate trip in the Shadowfell a while back. The glow was present and helped get him home but then disappeared as he stood on the side of a road next to a corpse.

When entering the house fully, Idris lost his footing and fell through the rotted floor into the basement of the house where he discovered that every valuable item that may have once been there was taken. Boxes broken, old barrels empty, ...

Viola ran around the house and discovered a back door that was closer to the source of the glow, and she discovered it seemed to emanate like smoke from a cocooned corpse of a man lying against the half-broken wall.

Abokar managed to find the right paths and stronger floor. He ignited his axe and used its fire to clear a way through the cobwebs, leading the way for others in the group.

Ruby had cast Detect Magic and, when closer to the body of the man, discovered the smoke to be magic. When prying deeper into its arcane secrets, she discovered something unseen to her. The magic seemed to mostly be the 'absence' of magic and every magic school, wildly shifting between different schools of magic or even to unknown things.

### There's the spider

![A_scene_in_a_Dungeons_ _Dragons_5e_style_latest_converted](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/c0bdbc3f-37ee-4181-86b1-1469fb1b2a6e)

Nickolas had found some strong larger planks and was helping clear the way from cobwebs when everyone suddenly heard the short scream of pain from both Idris and an unknown monstrous creature from down in the basement.

In a panic, Viola transformed into a bear, ran through the backdoor, and jumped through the bad floor to attack anything arrayed against them. She unfortunately dropped straight on the paralyzed body of Idris, causing it to begin bleeding out.

Abokar jumped down with his axe on fire, Ruby produced several balls of light illuminating the scene, and Nickolas immediately saved Idris through healing magic. The group was worried though, because despite the bleeding having stopped, Idris was unmoving and his veins were bulging and discolored. Before anything else could happen, a huge monster of a spider 'popped' into existence in the corner of the room and it bit into Abokar's neck, attempting to similarly poison and paralyze him as was done previously to Idris.

With a combined effort of the group, the 'phase spider' was defeated, and the group began tending to Idris and discussing visiting the temple for assistance.

### The blue smoke has an effect
They decided to first finish the investigation, so they tied a safety rope to the leg of the bear and around the torso of Abokar as he bravely stepped into the blue smoke surrounding the body of what was assumed to be Raffael.

There was a loud crack and a quick shift of the blue smoke into Idris, and to everyone's surprise, the limp body of Idris began flying around as if under intelligent control. This shocked Ruby into firing unknown damaging magic towards Idris that caused Idris to quickly fly, still paralyzed, to a corner of the room to stay very still.

### A greasy parchment burned with a snake symbol
The blue glow and smoke had disappeared, and Abokar was able to retrieve a parchment folded up. When Nickolas investigated, they discovered remnants of Hum Dust, similar to the impure sample shown by Lord Greystone. The parchment was peculiar as it was greasy on the inside and it had the signature burned into it of a coiled serpent.

### Who Knows?

![A_close-up_scene_in_a_Dungeons_ _Dragons_5e_style_latest_converted](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/e04f1afe-932d-4d41-931b-45e0ae01ac74)

After a brainstorming session between the group, Ruby and Nickolas eventually remembered that there was a shop called the Serpent's Quill that sold all sorts of papers, parchment, and other writing equipment. Before leaving, the group managed to piece together a rough timeline of what had happened and they came to the conclusion the man died first, then the house exploded. It also seems like the blue smoke was slowly reappearing from parts of the body and surroundings that slowly degrade. The party decided to head to the temple to heal Idris when Idris began to slowly fight off the poison on his own. He was soon flying, walking and talking on his own again. At that point, the temple was no longer required, so the group continued discussing their next steps and headed to the Inn when the group noticed a sound and a roof tile suddenly sliding down above them.

Expecting they were being spied on, Idris immediately scaled the house to the roof (after discovering he lost the ability to fly), and together with Ruby's flying squirrel, they heard and tried chasing a running person down the streets below but were eventually unable to follow.

The group followed the tracks of the running person in the mud all the way to the cobblestone streets that lead deeper into the town. The tracks became impossible to follow at this point. Suspicious of who might have sent someone to follow them, the group decided to head back to the Muddy Boot Inn and further discuss plans there. Suspects were thrown around; Lord Greystone may have sent someone? Perhaps Huxley, the captain of the guards? The servants of Greystone or perhaps the homeless lady had said something? At this point, they met up with Rono Cley, their other companion who waiting at the Muddy Boot Inn for the group and what they had discovered.

### A nights rest and weird dreams
The group, after discussing things, decided to rest for the night and meet up at the well in front of the casino The Wishing Well the next morning as the sun rises.

Viola invited Idris to relax with a massage at her place and sleep there, in order to help heal from the stress and troubles he received. Abokar retired to his own house, not too far away, while Ruby, Nickolas, and Rono decided to (reluctantly for some) rent rooms at the Muddy Boot Inn from Lisa, the owner of the inn.

Idris ended up having strange dreams about flying around, blue smoke, and his hands turning blue and eventually about his parents in the dusty plains of his homeworld explaining how the spirits can be a boon to us but also dangerous. And that he should never forget to ... at that point his dream cut out completely and the rest of his night was blackness.

### The Serpent's Quill

![A_bustling_medieval_street_with_various_shops_and_latest_converted](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/93d4ca3d-0597-416f-9c7f-1c241f0ef7bb)

In the morning, the group got together at the well, keeping a suspicious eye out for any spies or shady characters following them. Under the guidance of Nickolas and Ruby, who had visited the shop before to purchase parchment, they found and entered the Serpent's Quill. Inside, they were greeted by the owner of the shop, a diminutive gnome, with bright, inquisitive eyes who wore his glasses very deep down on his nose. They caught him, with thread and needle, busy at his workstation, binding a book.

When initially questioned, he disclosed that he does indeed create special parchments with oils and greases to protect it and isolate things. Making parchment waterproof, for example, or being able to help hold dangerous materials.

When asked about his clientele, he was very reluctant to share. He takes the confidentiality of all his clients very seriously.

The session ends with the group standing in the Serpent's Quill shop and considering how to approach the situation and find the information they need about the shady man with the bear-topped cane.

## Sausages And Exotic Goods

### The Serpent's Quill

The group talks with the gnome Eldwin Fizzlebang, but she won't give up the name of who buys the special parchment. Abokar and Viola end up putting pressure on the shopkeeper by blocking her shop and redirecting customers away, claiming they are conducting a murder investigation.

Ruby ends up buying the information through pressure from the group and a significant amount of coin, alongside a ruby-colored waterproof spellbook and ink. Eldwin keeps all her sales in a ledger with the names of the buyers. Ruby checks the names and sees several purchases by one Jasper Quickfoot for *H-D Parchment - Handle With Care - Greased*.

### Tracking Down Jasper

After asking around for an hour or so, they eventually find a farmer who likes drinking at a tavern called The Shaded Alley, which caters more to the locals. He remembers seeing a guy there with a walking cane that has a carved bear. Viola inquires further, discovering that such walking canes are probably sold at The Fox's Fancy, a unique wood workshop that creates customized and affordable walking canes and wood carvings. Abokar knows of the place. The Shaded Alley is owned by an elf named Selene Nightshade and is known as a spot away from most tourists. It's open 24/7 and usually managed by Selene in the evenings. It's also known as a place where you can find almost anything for the right price if you talk to the right people.

The group decides to split up: Viola, Idris, and Ruby go to check out The Shaded Alley, while Abokar and Nickolas track down The Fox's Fancy.

### The Shaded Alley

Viola, Idris, and Ruby arrive at The Shaded Alley, a tavern located between a poorer area and the rich marketplace and casino streets. They make sure not to arrive at the same time, with Viola taking up an oversight position without being seen.

As noon approaches, the place gets very busy with locals who work at shops or casinos popping in for a bite to eat and relax. A well-known sausage cart in front of the tavern, owned by Thalor Ironfist, has a long line of customers. The tavern isn't packed yet, but it's getting busier by the minute.

Idris uses his mystical talents to turn Ruby invisible. She successfully weaves through the people to enter the tavern unseen. The barkeep, a green-behind-the-ears young lad, is stressed and trying to handle the influx of people. Viola manages to get behind the bar and snoop around to find a key to the storeroom. She mostly finds a bag of gold, a locket, and many mugs and bottles of drink. In her attempt to sneak away, she runs invisibly into the young lad, who starts panicking and hyperventilating.

Screaming in terror, he runs out of the tavern, shouting about something he can't see. Idris, with the help of Thalen, calms the lad down and convinces him it was probably a ghost. Idris, as a mystic, offers to take care of it. Thalen drags the barkeep back to the tavern and pushes away a patron already grabbing free ale from the unmanned bar.

Idris manages to bring the young boy to an almost catatonic state by performing an actual seance, making the eyes on a skull he carries light up and speaking in a Xhorhasian accent. This draws the attention of everyone, who start excitedly gossiping. During the seance, Idris sees a scene play out in greyscale of the same tavern, with two patrons, a man and a woman, sitting at a table and getting into an escalating fight. The woman eventually draws a knife and stabs the man. An elfish woman behind the bar then draws a crossbow and shoots the knife-wielding patron, who falls down. As the woman dies, she makes eye contact with Idris and dies with a bloody grin on her face.

Idris tells everyone to hire him for other ghostly problems. Meanwhile, Ruby, still invisible, sneaks into and hides in the storeroom just as she becomes visible again. She finds barrels of ale, boxes of salted meats and bread, and a small chest containing sacks of different powders: white, black, orange, etc. Viola observes the patrons, but most are just enjoying the show while munching on sausages.

After the activity, Viola joins Idris outside without being noticed, and they stand in line for their own sausages, waiting for Nickolas and Abokar to return.

### The Fox's Fancy

Nickolas and Abokar enter The Fox's Fancy, confronted with a shop covered in sawdust and wood chippings. At the front of the shop is an excited half-elf named Lorianne Swiftglade, who ushers them inside to sell her wares.

Nickolas and Abokar come up with a plan to ask if she can make a walking cane with a carved bear that has a hidden compartment. Lorianne excitedly says she can and shows them drawings of her previous wood carvings. One of them is a bear, which she reveals was for a kind gentleman named Jasper who owns a local market cart that sells and buys exotic goods. She gives them the location of his cart.

After some more back and forth, Nickolas buys a wooden figurine of The Allhammer after she reveals a closet filled with carvings of all the pantheons in various shapes and sizes. She explains that these sell well. Everything is priced at just 2 silver. Lorianne reveals that it takes her almost the same time to make a small statue as it does to create a large one. When questioned about her documents for the wood, she gets flustered and digs deep into her chests to find an old parchment about the purchase of a large quantity of wood.

They also place a custom order for the same walking cane that Jasper uses, with the addition of a hollow interior that can be opened. This will take her a day or two to complete. They pay 2 silver up front and will pay 2 silver upon receiving the product.

### Spying on Jasper Quickfoot

Abokar and Nickolas find the cart and spy on it. They see a man dressed in a nicely tailored outfit with a big dark cloak lying beside him. Leaning against the cart is a cane with a bear carving. The man, assumed to be Jasper, is acting suspiciously and selling a small hand-sized crate covered with a cloth to a customer. The patron and he are leaning in close, whispering, nodding, and seemingly haggling over the price in a very suspicious manner.

Abokar and Nickolas follow the customer to his home and interrogate him in their capacity as a city watch sergeant and agent of the council, causing the man much distress. He sends his small familyâ€”consisting of a girl, a boy, and his wifeâ€”off to a side room when the girl complains about being hungry.

They convince the man they are investigating his purchase, so he shows them the small crate. Abokar immediately leans over the crate and listens to the man's confusion. He uncovers the crate to reveal a small pie covered in syrup and yellow pieces of fruit, which the man thinks is called *ango*. Nickolas corrects him, saying it's *mango* and that they sometimes contain insects, so they should inspect it by listening.

Abokar listens closely but hears nothing, so they take their leave to regroup with the rest.

### The Fat Pigeon

Both groups reconvened and shared the information they gathered from both locations. Idris had a craving for a sausage, so they split up briefly once again. Viola, Abokar, and Nickolas went to spy on Jasper at his cart, labeled *Jasper's Exotic Goods - Buying and Selling*. Meanwhile, Idris and Ruby stayed in line to buy five sausages, chatting with Mr. Ironhand, the owner of the sausage cart, about their group and Idris's mystical abilities. They could tell he enjoyed engaging in conversation with his customers. They returned to the group with the sausages in hand.

The group then kept watch for the rest of the afternoon near Jasper's cart. Viola summoned a fat city pigeon, which perched atop the cart, listening in on Jasper's transactions.

Jasper continued his mysterious behavior, selling a man a "Seashell of Whisperings" for 2 gold, claiming it could let him hear the whispers of his enemies. The closer they got, the clearer the voices would become. Jasper insisted it was a very unique item. After the sale, he took out a new shell from a box and placed it on his cart.

Viola's pigeon took a closer look at the cart's contents, noticing many knick-knacks and several strongboxes that seemed to be locked and of higher quality.

Ruby decided to approach Jasper and asked for *Yunfaalyu*, which puzzled him. He repeated, *Yushahshu*? When she inquired about anything from Wildemount, he hesitated and then tried to sell a "Map of Shifting Sands." Viola's fat pigeon landed on it, and Ruby used this as an excuse to dismiss Jasper, claiming the map was worthless because a pigeon had sat on it, then she walked away.

Eventually, Jasper packed up his goods and headed home. Viola transformed into a spider and hid under the cart, hitching a ride to his house. Ruby's flying squirrel tracked them and relayed information to the rest of the group. Once home, Jasper made a quick meal and then sat at a table, measuring something onto parchment. As a spider, Viola observed Jasper working with Hum-Dust, clearly hearing and seeing his activities. She rushed out to meet up with the group outside and informed them that Jasper was inside, currently handling Hum-Dust.

## Quickfoot Caught Red-Handed

### Approaching the House

The group was informed by Viola that Jasper was currently occupied with something involving the drug Hum-Dust. Deciding to take immediate action, they split up. Nickolas and Ruby approached the front door, while Abokar and Idris went to the back. Viola slipped into the shadows.

Nickolas knocked on the front door, but when no one answered, Abokar began banging on the back door. When there was still no response, Abokar used a crowbar to break down the back door.

They found Jasper in the middle of the room, looking flustered and holding a small chest. Abokar ordered him to surrender. However, as Jasper pretended to comply, he quickly set down the chest, opened it, and pulled out a scroll. Jasper tried to intimidate Abokar, claiming it was a scroll of ultimate doom, and that Abokar and his thieving crew should leave his house!

Abokar called his bluff and rushed forward with his axe. Jasper, panicking, began reading the scroll, which to everyone's shock exploded into blood. Where the blood landed, it pooled together and burst into flames. Out of the fire, two demon Dretches emerged and began attacking.

### Into the Dark

![Dretch](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/5154f4e5-09dd-4b1f-bfb0-ece335eee9a2)

Idris rushed in through the back door, and Nickolas abandoned the stubborn front door that wouldn't open, opting to climb through a window instead. The Dretches released a foul green smoke that poisoned everyone nearby.

Abokar, with his axe now aflame with blood, struck one of the demons, while Idris used his mystical powers to make one of the Dretches emit a truly hideous laughter, incapacitating it.

From outside, Viola enchanted several stones and threw one through the window, hitting Jasper on the head. Seeing how things were quickly going out of hand, Jasper waved his hands and cast Darkness, concealing his retreat upstairs.

Idris and Abokar continued battling the demons downstairs, while Nickolas chased Jasper through the darkness upstairs. Viola used special boots to run vertically up the walls and across the roof, while Ruby kept watch on the outside windows.

Ruby suddenly noticed Jasper peeking through one of the upstairs windows. She and Jasper had a quick magical duel, both flinging destructive spells at each other. Jasper attempted to retreat, but Viola managed to ricochet a stone that hit Jasper on the head again, causing him to curse loudly.

Jasper ran to another window just as Idris appeared upstairs, having finished off the demons downstairs with Abokar. Idris called upon the spirits to do his bidding, and with the ringing of breaking glass, the protective magic around Jasper shattered. He was left defenseless and cornered by Nickolas and Viola.

Viola and Nickolas intimidated him in their own ways, but Jasper got truly scared of Viola for some reason.

Facing overwhelming odds, Jasper began to de-escalate and tried to negotiate.

### The Truth and Nothing But the Truth

The group dragged a slightly battered Jasper to a chair downstairs and cuffed him in irons.

Idris searched through some chests in the attic and found several stacks of greasy parchment. Unable to resist, he licked some of the grease and briefly felt as if he saw himself opening a chest in front of him while still standing where he was, taking psychic damage from the experience.

Meanwhile, downstairs, Abokar began demanding answers from Jasper, roughing him up. Viola questioned Jasper to see if he realized the terrible consequences of selling the drugs.

Nickolas cast a Zone of Truth, which caused Jasper to speak only the truth, much to his confusion. This revealed that he got the scroll that summoned the demons from a friend named Balun, a dwarf with red scruffy hair and beard who travels with caravans and occasionally visits Kymal and the Shaded Alley with interesting stories and items.

During the interrogation, they discovered that several months ago, Jasper was approached by someone called The Alchemist in the Shaded Alley. The man looked like a 60-year-old human with short grey hair, no beard, and very sallow, sunken cheeks. Jasper met him only once in person. The Alchemist wanted Jasper to distribute Hum-Dust for him, as itâ€™s very exotic and would sell well. Every two weeks, Jasper goes to a sewer grate under the large stairs near the big crane and mine entrance, where he leaves a bag of 50 silver and an empty greased-up Hum-Dust bag. An hour later, he returns to retrieve the full bag of Hum-Dust and his now-empty bag of silver, which he then sells.

### Dust, Dust Everywhere Around the City

![HumDustBag](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/212a6d9c-81a1-4c32-82c4-cf75ef0b6f05)


Viola also managed to get Jasper to describe all the people and places where he had been selling Hum-Dust, though he didnâ€™t know any of the people's names.

He described many people, but his most common customers seemed to be:

- An elderly man with a hunched back, a scruffy gray beard, and hair perpetually covered in a fine layer of coal dust. His clothes are tattered and patched, made from rough, durable materials that have seen better days. His face is lined with deep wrinkles. He is often found near "Iron Forge Alley," a narrow street lined with abandoned blacksmith shops.

- A middle-aged woman with stringy black hair, usually tied back with a rag. Her face is smudged with dirt, and her clothes are worn and threadbare, a mix of hand-me-downs and items scavenged from refuse piles. She can often be found at "Copper Vein Market," a bustling but rundown market district where the poorest gather to trade.

- A wiry, nervous-looking dwarf with a shock of unkempt brown hair and piercing green eyes. He wears an oversized coat with numerous pockets, all of which jingle faintly. His face is often covered in soot, making him blend in with the grimy cityscape. Frequently seen near "Silver Shaft Row," a district of crumbling tenements and abandoned mining shafts.

- A tough, muscular woman with short-cropped hair and a face marked by old scars and soot. Her clothes are heavily patched, and she wears thick boots caked with mud and grime. She spends her time in "Bronze Boulders," an area known for its derelict foundries and smithies.

- A gaunt woman in her late twenties, with hollow cheeks and dark, sunken eyes. Her hair is greasy and tangled, and she wears a mix of clothing that looks like itâ€™s been pieced together from various finds. Her appearance is ghostly, and she haunts the "Quicksilver Quarters," a district near the outskirts of the city filled with the ruins of old mining equipment and deserted houses.

- A frail, elderly figure with a long, white beard and a hunched posture. His clothes are little more than rags, and he carries a well-worn walking stick. His hands are calloused, and his face is deeply lined. He is usually found at a small city park named "The Green Circle."

The group learned that Jasper was actually planning to go to the Alchemist's drop-off location this evening for a fresh supply of Hum-Dust. With about an hour left until the drop-off, the group must now decide how to handle the situation. They have uncovered all the details they could but are now left with an imminent drop-off and Jasper, who continues to try to strike a deal to let him go and continue his business, even without the Hum-Dust.

### The Loot

During this session, the group managed to find two stacks of special greased parchment in the attic, which Idris took with him. Ruby found and took two scrolls, one for "Enhance Ability" and one for "Silence," in the chest that Jasper was trying to escape with.

The chest also contained a single unidentified potion and two bags. One was a leather bag, also greased up, which held the Hum-Dust. The second bag appeared to be crafted from opulent velvet or brocade, feeling soft and smooth to the touch, with a deep emerald green color.

Viola discreetly checked Jasper and stealthily took an obsidian orb he was carrying, using the pretense of retrieving his dagger to cover this action.

## One Two Three Feather to Tree

### Cut the Bullshit, We're Taking You In

As Jasper continued to try and bargain for his freedom, the group decided to drag him to the city barracks. Conveniently, the barracks were on the way to the hum dust drop-off point at the bottom of the large stairs and crane. With less than an hour until the drop-off, the clock was ticking.

Meanwhile, Viola split off from the group and tracked down a homeless man in a dark and grimy alley. What transpired there is currently unknown. The group wondered why Viola keeps disappearing or seeking time alone, but they had bigger fish to fry. They moved a shackled Jasper through the streets, passing the Maiden's Wish, and attracting attention. To avoid further notice, they took some unused side alleys.

Along the way, they investigated some items they had *cough* confiscated from the "crime scene." They found a very fancy bag that seemed to hold nothing but darkness. When they placed items inside and retrieved them, the items felt colder than when they went in. While playing around with the bag, they managed to retrieve a bag of 250 gold pieces. Jasper grew louder in his complaints until some creative use of a scroll of silence (jamming it in his mouth) quieted him down.

While traversing the lesser-traveled alleys, Abokar quickly realized they were being followed by three figures sticking to the shadows. He devised a cunning plan and decided to sneakily take a right while the rest of the group carried on.

### Kymal's Got a New Tree

Around this time, Idris asked the fancy bag for "keys" and retrieved a key that opened a small locked chest he had *cough* confiscated from Jasper's cart. Inside, he found a large ornate feather lying on a silk cushion. Enthusiastically, Idris began trying to write with it but noticed it didn't do anything. In a playful manner, he waved the feather in Ruby's face. On the third swish, the feather jumped out of his hands and instantly transformed into a massive 60-foot-high oak tree, its roots burying deep into the ground.

This massive tree partially blocked off the street between the group and Abokar and the three shady characters. The shock and distraction caused the shady followers to run past Abokar, complaining they'd lose them and needing to find a different route quickly.

### Not So Fast, Gentlemen

![medieval_spies_alley](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/62a0df48-e918-494c-aea7-236f2cbccf8e)

Abokar took this opportunity to confront the three men, lighting his axe on fire and intimidating them. In their shock, the central figure mentioned it was too soon for this. Refusing to say anything else, they tried to scatter. However, the group was prepared. Abokar blocked their way back, Idris climbed the tree and watched from above, and Nickolas prepared his magic to stop one in his tracks. One of the men managed to squeeze past Abokar with unexpected acrobatic feats, running down the road toward the busy market and casino central road of Kymal. Another tried to scale the roof, but Nickolas' magic froze him completely, allowing Abokar to bind him under Ruby's watchful eye. The third man scaled the building on the right and ran across the rooftops, but Idris swiftly followed and stabbed him deeply. In shock, he ran away to hide. Idris called upon spirits, holding a skull and whispering foul magic that found the hidden spy and caused him to bleed out and die.

### Quickfoot is Rather Quick of Foot

As the dust settled from the brief fight and chase, Nickolas and Ruby noticed that Jasper had managed to flee in the confusion. Nickolas attempted to track him down but concluded that Jasper had managed to weasel away.

Meanwhile, Abokar and Ruby interrogated the remaining spy, who turned out to be very frightened. He gave his name as Josh, though he initially tried to pass as Joshua. He revealed they were supposed to spy on the group until they gathered somethingâ€”a special bag making 'noise'â€”and report back to someone named "The Bear" at the Wishing Well. He also mentioned sharing a room with his family there. Thalys, who knew the most, had been the one to run past Abokar.

Abokar decided to let Josh go with a warning, thoroughly scaring him. Josh became completely terrified when Idris jumped out of the tree holding the corpse of the third spy, whom Josh identified as Harold. Startled at being free, Josh stumbled away as fast as possible.

### Ominous Reports at the Barracks

After a scolding from Nickolas for killing the man, the group continued to the barracks. They were approached by guards who had been notified of someone carrying a dead person in the streets. Fortunately, one of the guards was an old friend of Abokar, Bruni Silvervein. After a quick discussion, Bruni asked Abokar to report to Huxley, but Abokar mentioned he was on a time limit for a secret investigation. Bruni agreed to process the body and keep it on ice in their dungeons.

Before they left, Bruni privately told Abokar that something strange was happening to some survivors from the ravager battle they were part of. Durnik and Gurni, who did mercenary work around Kymal, were now under the care of priests with strange wounds. The wounds appeared without any fight and healed mysteriously. Bruni asked Abokar to check in with Faragrim, another old crew member who became a blacksmith in Kymal.

### Scouting Out the Drop-Off

Viola, after her business, reached the hand-off location first. She hid behind bushes near a sewer grate built into the mountainside. Later, the rest of the group arrived, with Ruby scouting the area with her flying squirrel. Once clear, they hid in different locations. Idris perched high above, unknowingly close to Viola, who heard him muttering encouragement to himself. Abokar found a sturdy lock on the grate that could be opened from either side.

### Living Rock

![ominous_scene_with_hatch](https://github.com/JanStaelens/JanStaelens.github.io/assets/40687012/b8a2c911-c725-4f6c-86d4-e1884303baec)

Abokar, Nickolas, and Ruby hid some 60 feet away behind houses while Ruby kept watch on the grate. During their discussion, she noticed the grate unlock and open but saw nothing exit. Viola and Idris missed this due to shadows and wind. Ruby saw the bag disappear and warned the others. Viola saw the grate open again, suspecting someone had left. Ruby sent her squirrel into the grate, but it was killed.

The noise prompted Viola to rush to the grate and face a creature resembling living rock with glowing purple eyes and veins of purple and pink liquid. She swiped the lock, threw it away, and started running away, only to meet Abokar and Ruby sprinting toward the grate. They saw the creature heading deeper into a stairway and dark, wet tunnel.

### The Descent

The group decided to descend. Ruby, agitated, led the way without caring for stealth. Her pet's death perhaps fueling her desire for revenge. She cast her magic to illuminate the stairway and tunnel, which quickly turned into a natural cave system with glowing mushrooms and stalactites and stalagmites. Despite the rough terrain, Ruby rushed forward, followed closely by Idris. The rest of the group lagged behind as Ruby and Idris arrived at a dimly lit area with rotten wooden walls in front of them. She saw a dark pit with broken planks behind the wood. But more importantly she saw more light from beyond a heavy metal gate attached to the cave walls. She decided to climb the gate. As she climbed, she felt a sensation like a soap bubble bursting and saw two glowing purple eyes blink at her from the stone to her right. Idris arrived just in time to see a massive stone fist attempt to punch Ruby, who was just starting to climb.

## The Alchemist

### When Mountains Start Moving

Entering the sewer grate, the group descended into a semi-natural cave system that ended with an iron gate. Ruby noticed she could try to climb it, but when she touched the gate, the wall next to her began to move.

It was revealed to be an alchemical golem, which punched Ruby and took a defensive position in front of the gate. Purple liquid flowed between the cracks of its runic-covered stone, resembling veins.

The party retreated to recover their wits, assisted by Ruby manipulating gravity to slow the creature. Viola called upon her powers and summoned a large black wolf, which appeared unhealthy at first.

The golem did not chase them but stood guard at the gate. The party heard someone beyond the gate awakening and packing up. They assumed the alchemist, who had been sleeping, was now aware of them and trying to escape.

With renewed vigor, the attack continued. Viola hurled magical rocks at the golem, and her wolf bit off pieces. Arrows were expertly aimed at its weak points, and axes cleaved deeply. In retaliation, the golem unleashed a toxic gas from its liquid veins but to no avail. Ruby danced around the creature, slashing until it crumbled into rubble. With newfound speed, Ruby jumped across the gap above the iron gate. Abokar used Betsy, his crowbar, to bend the lock and open the way to the next chamber.

### The Alchemist's Lab

The next chamber appeared to be a natural cave repurposed as a living area and laboratory. There was no sign of the alchemist, indicating the guardian successfully delayed attackers so he could escape.

Ruby and Nickolas did not give up easily. The group found an alternative exit via a small ladder leading to a large natural cave complex. Ruby rushed through the cave at extreme speeds, following the right-hand side, while Nickolas followed the left-hand side.

Meanwhile, Abokar guarded the main entrance to ensure the alchemist did not sneak past. Idris and Viola searched the room. Idris found a spider silk rope, which seemed strong but prone to unraveling. He also discovered a half-burned letter, which read:

> "Alistair, Continue your work on diluting the Hum Dust and refining the formula to reduce fatalities. Use test subjects that won't attract attention. 
  Stay hidden and maintain discretion at all times. Report your progress to the lighthouse within the month and we'll make sure your daughter is taken care of. As usual, be on the lookout for other fragments. Return immediately if you encounter any such signs. Do not fail in this task."

 ***The rest of the letter is burned***

The letter included a symbol of concentric circles, unfamiliar to the group.

### Deep into the Mountain

Ruby and Nickolas continued their speedy run through the maze of tunnels in an attempt to catch up to the alchemist, navigating mostly by senses other than sight. Surprisingly, they ran into each other when Ruby circled back. Ruby cast her magic to illuminate the scene before they began attacking each other.

The rest of the group, including Viola carrying her wolf, reunited. Abokar and Viola focused on tracking, successfully following muddy prints through the tunnels.

The natural caves transitioned to mine shafts and man-made tunnels with wooden struts and mining cart rails. Tracking became more difficult, but the group deduced the alchemist was trying to escape outside. They followed the fresh air flow, moving upward until reaching a crosspoint with signs of a battle and drag marks leading to a partially collapsed mine shaft.

### Something Fell on Idris Again

![Carrion Crawler](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97be3c82-421b-47c8-b06b-18f4782fa547)


In the dark mining tunnels, they squeezed through a collapsed section single file. Nickolas noticed some strange slime that numbed his fingers on contact. Viola's wolf froze in fear upon spotting something ahead. Abokar pushed forward and saw a long-abandoned storage room with bones scattered around. At the far end lay the body of a man, unmoving.

As the group entered and investigated, Viola shouted, "Don't forget to look up!" Idris looked up and saw the ceiling moving, signaling the massive Carrion Crawler to drop onto him and attack.

A battle ensued. Despite their exhaustion, the group used their last tricks to defeat the beast. Nickolas' magical words of encouragement healed and incited Abokar to attack faster. Viola expertly aimed enchanted rocks through the small gap in the collapsed tunnel.

Eventually, the beast lay slain, and the group investigated the corpse.

### Finding Pure Hum Dust

Idris took charge and cut open the clothing of the alchemist's corpse, discovering many precious items, including a beautiful glass flask containing brightly shining rainbow-colored dust. The flask exuded a constant hum, indicating they had found the pure Hum Dust.

The corpse had several other items: a ceramic jug with many stoppers, a healing potion, and a vial of murky white liquid. The man wore a simple gold band, which Idris took. Abokar carried the body, and the group followed the mine tracks to find the nearest exit.

### Exiting Above the City of Kymal

After a long journey through the damp mining tunnels, the group (minus the wolf) emerged at the top of a large stairway next to a massive crane. They breathed the clean air, overlooking the city of Kymal with its many lights mirroring the stars above. The distant sounds of the casinos echoed hauntingly.

The group decided to return to the alchemist's lab, with the grate entrance under the large stairs. Viola, needing a break, headed off alone. In this quiet moment, Nickolas noticed that Viola did not breathe unless speaking, a strange observation he kept to himself.

### Viola's Walk

Viola walked through the night shadows to The Shaded Alley, a place where one could find anything, legal or not. Upon arrival, she was recognized by Selena Nightshade, the tavern owner.

Viola confronted Selena, who revealed she knew Viola's name and companions but little else. Viola inquired about the best alchemists and potioneers. Initially, she was directed to Faelar Willowshade, a respectable elf potioneer near The Wishing Well casino. Pushing for more, Selena implied a price for further information. Viola stole a money purse from a customer and handed it to Selena, who laughed and warned her of more observant patrons.

Selena then directed Viola to Varis Nightbloom, a Tiefling renting Room 23 at the Gilded Lily Inn, for more exotic alchemical items.

### Forceful Identification

Meanwhile, the group reentered the alchemist's lab to identify their items. Abokar identified a potion of water breathing and a vial of Carrion Crawler mucus, though he was puzzled by his sudden knowledge.

Ruby found a beautiful white pearl, which she used in rituals to identify a ring as a Ring of Poison Resistance and the jug as an Alchemist's Jug.

Finally, the group gathered around the flask of Hum Dust. Ruby discovered the flask itself was magical, capable of temporarily dispelling magic. Strangely, the dust inside still hummed with magic.

Curious, Ruby used the lab's equipment to extract a spoonful of the dust. The surrounding air grew cerulean as a blue glow appeared around the dust. When Ruby cast Identification and touched the blue, a loud crack sounded, and an unknown magical effect entered her. Persistently, she continued to reach for the dust as more blue glow began to form.

### The Loot

- Ring of Poison Resistance
- Potion of Healing
- Vial of Carrion Crawler Mucus
- Poorly Made Spider Silk Rope (20 ft)
- Alchemist's Jug
- Potion of Water Breathing
- Pearl worth 100 gp
- Flask of Dispel Magic holding Pure Hum Dust
- Letter addressed to Alistair the Alchemist
- Alchemist Kit
- Poisoner's Kit

## What is Humdust

### Chaotic Investigation

Ruby continued experimenting with the mysterious substance known as Humdust. Her inquisitive nature led her to forcibly interact with the substance, resulting in a series of wild magic surges. The group witnessed a myriad of magical phenomena, including:

1. Ruby's sudden ability to spiderwalk.
2. The summoning of a Fog Cloud.
3. A bizarre moment where Ruby lost all her hair.
4. The triggering of a resurrection effect in case of death.
5. The unfortunate casting of a 5th-level Magic Missile on herself.

Despite the chaos, the group managed to glean crucial information about Humdust:

- The substance is identified as ground diamond dust.
- Ingesting Humdust induces vivid hallucinations and dreams, followed by confusion. Excessive consumption can transform the user into a magical nexus.
- When casting spells through the blue fog surrounding Humdust, the spell's effects are doubled, but at the cost of triggering two wild magic surges.
- The device used to create Humdust can be recognized or constructed by Ruby now. The process involves infusing diamond dust with energy from an object roughly the size of a fist.

Ruby's reckless experimentation eventually caused her to lose consciousness. Fortunately, the group was able to stabilize her and heal the injuries sustained during the magical surges.

### Cleaning Up the Mess

After taking a short rest outside, the group faced the challenge of safely handling the remaining Humdust. They deliberated over the best course of action and ultimately decided to return the dust to its container and use Dispel Magic to neutralize its effects.

Abokar bravely approached the blue glow once more to return the spoonful of dust to the bottle. However, this interaction caused him to experience a brief moment of terror, during which he became irrationally frightened of Idris.

### The Abduction of Rono Clay

Meanwhile, Viola arrived at a bustling tavern where city guards were taking inventory and filing a report about a fight and abduction earlier that morning. The victim, an older man identified as Rono Clay, had been defending himself with a pistol before being overpowered and taken away by a group of hooded figures.

Lisa, who had sustained a black eye during the altercation, recounted the event to the guards while Viola listened intently. She described how the hooded individuals had engaged in a fierce struggle with Rono before knocking him unconscious and abducting him.

The guards, along with Lisa, managed to clean up most of the damage, though several walls were riddled with bullet holes, and one window had been hastily boarded up.

Viola eventually reunited with Nickolas, and the two of them retired to their respective rooms, reflecting on the troubling events that had unfolded.

### A Spicy Room

Ruby and Idris decided to indulge in a luxurious stay at the Golden Hearth Inn. Their chosen room was an opulent suite, complete with a cozy bed adorned with heart-shaped pillows and mirrors covering every surface, including the ceiling. The atmosphere was one of decadent comfort. The room was clearly intended for more... active nights.

### A Very Quick Gamble

The following morning, Viola ventured out to test her luck with a single gold coin, hoping to turn it into a hundred. She briefly entered the Dragon's Hoard casino but left quickly when they insisted she check her walking stick as a weapon. She then moved on to the Maiden's Wish that did not require checking-in weaponry, where she exchanged her gold for chips and attempted a few simple casino games.

Unfortunately, her luck was not on her side, and she lost all her money. Disheartened, she rejoined the group, contemplating the risks and rewards of gambling.

### Ambush with Guns

The group found themselves embroiled in a heated debate about what to do with the remaining Humdust. While their word had been given to deliver it to Lord Greystone, some members of the group expressed concerns about the potential dangers of entrusting such a volatile substance to him. They also recognized its significant monetary value, further complicating the decision.

As their argument grew louder in the open square, they were suddenly ambushed by gunfire. Four shots rang out, and bullets struck the ground around Nickolas, wounding him. Viola reacted instinctively, her scream transforming into a bear-like roar as she scaled the wall of the tallest building and charged toward two of the shooters.

Nickolas quickly cast a charm spell on the two assailants near Viola, causing them to drop their weapons, which fell to the ground below. Meanwhile, the two shooters on the opposite rooftop fired another round at Nickolas, but their shots missed. They then ducked behind cover, attempting to conceal themselves.

Realizing that Nickolas was the primary target, Idris used his magic to render him invisible, providing some measure of protection from the ongoing assault.

## Chains That Bind

### Bullets are flying

As the dust from the first few seconds of battle begins to settle, two of the ambushers have disappeared onto the rooftops while the other two are engaged in combat with a giant bear. Nickolas, now visible and no longer under fire, scrambles up the side of a building, eager to distract one of the attackers and assist the strange viola-playing bear. Meanwhile, Idris concentrates on keeping Nickolas invisible while deftly loosing arrows at the attackers. Ruby, moving with incredible speed, ascends a building with graceful efficiency, her blade gleaming as she confronts one of the ambushers.

Abokar, feeling the surge of battle in his veins, races forward. His blood heats as he climbs towards the two mercenaries who are relentlessly stabbing at Viola in her bear form. A cut on his hand makes him feel his heartbeat throb through the wound as his blade ignites with flame.

The mercenaries seem focused entirely on their pistols and daggers, attacking the bear and Viola until she collapses. Fortunately, Nickolas is nearby to heal her while Abokar ensures she isnâ€™t taken down again.

Idris climbs a tree.

Meanwhile, Ruby, leaping between rooftops, chases one of the mercenaries. With a burst of magic, she pushes him off the roof to a long drop below, his body crashing onto the cobblestones, lifeless.

### Things are heating up

Suddenly, Abokar is no longer in the town squareâ€”heâ€™s transported back to a battlefield many years ago. Heâ€™s surrounded by ravagers, orcs, and goblins. His vision flickers between past and present, his body radiating more and more heat until the ground beneath him begins to char.

As Viola retreats to recover, Abokar cleaves through the mercenary. To him, however, itâ€™s a goblin. He hears the splintering of wood, smells the iron tang of blood, feels the sting of it in his eyes. Heâ€™s fighting in two places at once. As he advances on the last mercenary, a sudden spike of pain stabs through him. Looking down, he sees a goblin's spear piercing his stomach. The pain feels real, and the wound is there, visible. Ruby passes by, jokingly asking if he ate something wrong, seeing him clutch his stomach, though no visible attack had hit him.

### Idris falls

Idris falls out of a tree.

### Idris falls again

Idris sprints across a square dominated by a lion statue, shooting arrows at the last mercenary as he leaps across open ground. Two loud bangs ring out. Idris goes down with a meow of pain. Ruby, moving at blinding speed, closes in on the mercenary and engages in a brutal, almost dance-like battle. Crossbow bolts zip through the air, fired by Abokar, now partially collapsed on a rooftop. He begins shouting for a medic, yelling that Durnik has fallen!

Viola, having regained some of her strength, rushes back to the square, witnessing Idris being shot and rolling across the ground. She reaches him just in time to heal him back to life.

### Visions between life and death

As Idris awakens, he watches Abokar use a lamppost to descend from the rooftop. Everywhere Abokar steps, the ground is scorched, the air around him shimmering with heat. For a fleeting moment, Idris glimpses into the spirit realm, chains descending from the sky to wrap around Abokar. Blinking, the vision vanishes.

Meanwhile, Abokar finds himself back in a familiar nightmare. Heâ€™s chained to a bed, tubes pumping red, blood-like liquid into his body. He panics, using his strength to break free of the chains and pull out the tubes. Hands reach out to hold him down; distant voices shout as if underwater. "He's awake!" "Hold him down!" His vision begins to fade, but just before losing consciousness, he notices a sigil on one of the captors' sleevesâ€”a dagger pointing downward, surrounded by a drop of blood. The last thing he hears is, "Damn, I think this one failed."

### Making trauma disappear

As the last mercenary attempts to flee from Ruby, he drops from the roof and makes a desperate dash to escape. But heâ€™s chased by everyone except Nickolas and Viola. Viola, meanwhile, has returned to the rooftop where Nickolas has stabilized the two mercenaries left for dead by Abokar. She cradles one of their heads and sees into his dreamsâ€”visions of newly gained riches, roasted boar, and laughter with his comrades as they plan to delay a certain group from reaching Greystone Manor.

Nickolas watches silently, quietly manacling the unconscious mercenaries.

### The dust falls, the chains tighten

Idris releases an arrow that strikes true, hitting the last mercenary in the back of the head, ending the battle. But Abokar, lost in his vision, continues fighting unseen enemies, shouting about protecting Helga and Dunkirk. The heat around him intensifies, his heartbeat thundering in his ears. Idris watches in horror as he begins to hear the same heartbeat, echoing from deep within the spirit realm. It grows faster and faster until, abruptly, it stops. The world turns gray, time freezing. Abokar drops to the ground, thick metal chains wrapping around him. The chains stretch far into the sky, where an enormous female figure grins down at him. She notices Idris watching and grins wider, locking eyes with him. Her mouth opens as if to speak.

Meanwhile, Abokar is trapped in an endless loop. He wakes on the bed, pulls out the tubes, hears the same voices again and again. This nightmare repeats, over and over. Then, both Idris and Abokar hear a female voice reverberating through their minds:

â€œThree years of stolen breath are gone,  
Your borrowed life now wanes,  
The shadowâ€™s grip begins to dawn,  
And death for you remains.  

The soul you pledged, the devilâ€™s due,  
Now teeters on the brink,  
Unless three lives, near death like you,  
From fateâ€™s dark edge you drink.  

Through alchemyâ€™s ancient blood-bound rite,  
Their dying breath sustain,  
And in their lives your soulâ€™s new light,  
Shall break the devilâ€™s chain.â€

### The guards arrive

Time resumes. Only Idris and Abokar are aware of what just happened, but the entire group feels a surge of power, as if theyâ€™ve brushed against a well of infinite energy. Ruby shakes off the sensation and climbs back up to the rooftops, finding Viola cradling the second mercenaryâ€™s head. Ruby pokes her awake, and Viola calmly explains she was merely erasing any â€œtraumatic experiencesâ€ the mercenaries might have suffered.

Abokar stands, no longer burning but feeling a tightness in his chest, like the stress before an important exam. He pulls out his alchemy jug, asks for wine, and sits down on a bench to drink. Idris joins him, asking what just happened, who that woman was, and insisting that Abokar must *not* follow the instructions from the riddle.

Exhausted, Abokar recounts his visionsâ€”the battlefield, the sigil on the sleeve, the tubes, the voices, and the strange battle against what felt like hundreds of goblins.

As the conversation winds down, a group of guards arrives in the square. One grizzled veteran steps forward, demanding an explanation. Viola launches into a rapid explanation, and the guard slowly raises his eyebrow as he listens.

## Session 9: Prison

### The Return of Rono

As the guards surrounded our adventurers, Viola tried to explain everything, her words pouring out in a frantic stream. Before the grizzled veteran guard could interrupt, the sound of heavy footsteps and gunshots echoed through the square. Five more hooded figures appeared, opening fire, mostly targeting Nickolas.

The guards dove for cover as the veteran fired his crossbow. Viola, in a panic, jumped on Nickolas to protect him and turned him invisible. Before anyone else could react, two of the hooded men were taken out by a disheveled and battered Rono, who had appeared on a rooftop above them.

Nickolas broke free from Viola and took cover behind a large lion statue in the center of the square. Before he could shout anything, Ruby stepped forward and unleashed a devastating Gravity Spell. The spell obliterated the remaining three attackers, shattering the road, cracking the surrounding buildings, and creating a bloody explosion that painted the streetsâ€”and Ronoâ€”completely red.

A long pause followed as everyone tried to process the sudden and brutal end to the fight.

### The Guardsâ€™ Ultimatum

The loud and destructive display left the guards with no choice but to arrest the group. Despite their attempts to explain they were victims, something in Idris's words turned the guards against them. The adventurers were shackled and led through the main road of Kymal, attracting curious and gossiping onlookers.

As they were being led away, the veteran guard ordered Jenkins to collect the two original ambushers, showing little concern for the groupâ€™s warnings about leaving the mercenaries on the roof.

### Processed and Locked Up

At the barracks, the group was taken deep into the dungeons of Kymal. They were stripped of all their items, jewelry, and weapons, which were placed in the Evidence Room. Ruby managed to hide a small pendant, but Idrisâ€™s attempt to cast a spell was quickly stopped by the wary guards, knocking him out. Abokarâ€™s protests were met with firm resistance, and despite their objections, the entire group was locked up.

Abokar demanded to speak to Captain Huxley, but the guards told him to be quiet, saying Huxley wouldnâ€™t be back until tomorrow.

Left in the cold, damp dungeon, the only sounds were the drip of water and the faint rustle of cots.

### Ronoâ€™s Story

As some of the group rested, Rono began to explain his absence. After a fierce fight at the Muddy Boot Inn, he had been kidnapped and forced to work non-stop in a tinker shop, crafting weapons for an unknown group. Exhausted and desperate, he secretly made a pistol and an explosive. When most of his captors left, he struck, killing a lone guard and escaping. While finding his way through the city, he heard distant gunfire and rushed to the Lion Statue Square, arriving just in time to intervene.

### The Corrupt Patrol

Every hour, two guards, later identified as Jules and Cesar, patrolled past the cells, gossiping about random topics. One whispered to the other about a â€œhumming bottleâ€ in the Evidence Room, something they believed The Clasp would pay handsomely for. Realizing the potential danger of losing the Hum Dust, the group had a fierce debate, convincing Nickolas that staying in the cell could cost them everything, even if an escape would be illegal.

### Viola Embraces the Rat

Viola hatched a plan to check the Evidence Room. Using her abilities, she transformed into a rat and scurried toward the open door during the guardsâ€™ patrol. Unfortunately, they noticed the rat and were about to kill it until the group in the cell distracted them with loud shouting. Viola seized the opportunity to slip into the Evidence Room.

Inside, she found a complex Arcane and Mechanical Lock guarding their items. The guards had managed to open two of the five locks by trying different combinations. In an attempt to sabotage the lock, Viola accidentally triggered a poisoned needle trap, causing her to drop her form.

### A Close Call

Hearing the metal door rattle, Viola quickly changed back into a rat. The guards shot at her but missed as she scurried across the ceiling and walls, eventually slipping back into the cell. The guards, frustrated, decided to leave the â€œratâ€ among the prisoners.

Viola returned to the group and shared everything she had learned.

### Spooking the Guards into Chaos

During the next patrol, Idris seized the moment to confront the guards, threatening to report their corrupt behavior to the captain. With the groupâ€™s help, he revealed details only someone who had been in the Evidence Room could know, including the progress they had made on the locks. He claimed he had the spirits on his side. Intimidated, the guards offered to release them in exchange for their silence, but the group instead demanded that the guards lock themselves in the cell with them.

Idris and Ruby, not trusting the situation, decided to guard the Evidence Room themselves. As night fell, they all eventually drifted off to sleep, only to be rudely awakened by the changing of the guards, who immediately called for reinforcements and put everyone back into their cells. Jules and Cesar tried to convince the new guards that they were the victims, but no one believed them. Jules and Cesar were taken in shackled with the guards.

After the chaos, the group finally managed to get some rest, though Abokarâ€™s nightmares left him waking with a shout.

### Huxley Arrives

In the morning, Captain Huxley arrived and ordered a chair brought down to the cell. He listened as Abokar debriefed him on the events, including the Hum Dust and the groupâ€™s recent actions. Huxley pondered their story before deciding to accompany them to Lord Greystone, as they had been acting on his behalf. He hoped to convince Greystone not to use the dangerous Hum Dust and suggested using his alchemical skills to further investigate the substance.

Huxley also requested the note left by Alistair, The Alchemist, which spoke of a group holding his daughter hostage and mentioned needing to report back to "The Lighthouse." Though there is no lighthouse near Kymal, the group speculated it might refer to the temple at the center of town, though Huxley remained unconvinced.

With the promise to look into the note, Huxley returned the groupâ€™s gear and began escorting them to Greystone Manor.

## Session 10: Messy Mansions and Healing Temples

### Heading to the Mansion

Huxley accompanied the group back to the manor of Lord Halen Greystone. On the way, he explained that heâ€™d leave most of the talking to the group, as they had firsthand experience with the events. They kept a close watch for anyone following them but only saw a few old ladies gossiping about them. Viola, annoyed, approached the women, scaring them off.

### Meeting Greystone in His Lab

The group was let in by Boris, the butler, who led them to Lord Greystoneâ€™s lab. Greystone was busy with bubbling liquids and alchemical equipment, making pigments. The lab was chaotic, with colors splattered everywhere and pots of strange ingredients scattered about. 

The group, along with Huxley, explained the dangers of Hum Dust and how they had been under attack almost since the moment they left on their quest. They suspected someone in Greystoneâ€™s household might be responsible for a leak.

### Interrogation of Lia

Lia was called in for questioning. She swore she hadnâ€™t spoken to anyone about the group, except when asking where to buy some of the drugs when she goes to party near the Muddy Boot Inn. She couldnâ€™t remember mentioning the group specifically. When asked about Mila, they were told Mila was sick in her room and hadnâ€™t left all day. Nickolas and Rono decided to follow Boris to check on her.

### Mila's Room

Nickolas hesitated to enter after hearing a faint, sickly voice telling them she just needed rest. Rono, however, insisted they go in. Inside, they found Mila lying weakly on the bed. She was struggling to breathe and looked far older than her 53 years. When they first met her, Mila looked 18, thanks to a special cream called "EternaYouth." Now, she appeared to be 90 or even older. Rono picked her up and carried her to the rest of the group.

### A Rush to the Temple of the Lady of Luck

Seeing Milaâ€™s condition, the group decided to rush her to the Temple of the Lady of Luck for healing. Not everyone went. Lord Greystone, Boris, Rono, and Nickolas took Mila in a carriage. Huxley and Abokar followed in a cart they commandeered. Viola, Idris, and Ruby stayed behind at the mansion with Lia.

### Healing Mila

![DnD_Style_Church_Basement](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d78e1f3a-46b1-4026-8983-8a60d7a545aa)

At the temple, a brother greeted them and guided them to a basement filled with nurses and cots. The head cleric, Brother Eldon, was called. Recognizing Lord Greystone, he quickly grasped his holy symbol and cast Greater Restoration on Mila. Though she remained old, her health improved enough for her to sit up and talk.

Mila explained she had been using EternaYouth for years without issue. That morning, however, her usual dose didnâ€™t work, so she applied more. When it started making her older, she panicked and used a third dose, which left her in this state. The cream cost her 1,500 gold pieces, a fortune she had saved for years. With Brother Eldonâ€™s reassurance, she applied another dose and became young again. Abokar was able to secure a sample of the cream, promising a discount for Mila if he found an alchemist who could replicate it.

### Abokar Talks with Faragrim

While Nickolas helped heal others at the temple, Huxley noticed a man on one of the cots who hadnâ€™t left. Abokar recognized him as Faragrim, a fellow soldier and survivor of the battle three years ago.

Faragrim confided in Abokar that he had been experiencing mysterious wounds that would appear, heal, and then reappear. It started a few days ago, and though painful, he tried to dismiss it. Abokar mentioned he had felt something similar recently, as if stabbed by an invisible spear. Faragrim had also heard that others from the Silvercut Crossroads battle, like Durnik and Gurni, had strange injuries. He asked Abokar to help investigate, not for himself, but for Durnik and Gurni. He also mentioned hearing rumors about the Ravagers becoming a threat again, with missing trade caravans near the Crossroads.

### Idris and Ruby Prepare the Lab

Back at the mansion, Ruby and Idris headed to the lab to investigate the Hum Dust. While Ruby performed a ritual to detect magic, Idris couldnâ€™t resist touching everything. He eventually created a colorful, knotted cloth in one of the devices but ended up making a mess when the paint spilled everywhere. Ruby, meanwhile, entered a storeroom full of ingredients, sensing something magical, but it wasnâ€™t visible inside the room.

### Ruby Finds a Notebook

![Notebook_Alchemical_Experiments_Brown](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/760e75c9-cf4d-47cf-b55e-270177f84c25)

While searching the lab, Ruby found a notebook detailing various experiments with different ingredients, noting their reactions when heated, cooled, or distilled. She quickly found notes on Hum Dust, with repeated attempts to purify it, all ending with the word â€œbrownâ€ written in an increasingly frustrated tone.

### Idris' Storeroom Disaster

Idris eventually entered the storeroom Ruby had briefly explored and was drawn to a shiny bottle on a high shelf. When he climbed up to reach it, the entire cabinet fell over, sending ingredients and bottles crashing to the floor. In a panic, Idris attempted to turn the mess into a floor painting, but most of the colors turned brown, except for a small, angelic figure he painted.

### Viola and Lia

Meanwhile, Viola stayed with Lia in the kitchen. Lia shared more about her habits with Mila and mentioned that Lord Greystone was actual friends with Arnoud. They met at a play Arnoud had written and quickly became close, though Lia didnâ€™t know what they worked on together. 

Suddenly, a loud crash upstairs startled them. Lia pulled out a dagger, ready for anything. Viola transformed into a wolf and ran upstairs, fearing an ambush. She startled Ruby, who was trying to break into Lord Greystoneâ€™s office. Ruby cast a shadow blade, accidentally hitting Viola, causing them both to scream in shock and Viola to drop her wolf form.

### Idris Caught Red, Green, and Purple-Handed

Viola, returned to wolf form, rushed with Lia to the storeroom where the loud noise came from. There they found Idris proudly showing off his "art," surrounded by shattered bottles and spilled ingredients. The mess was enormous. Lia fainted at the sight of it. When she awoke, now covered in paint, Idris began magically cleaning her while Viola calmed her down.

### Ruby Breaks In

Meanwhile, Ruby had managed to unlock the door to Lord Greystoneâ€™s office. She tracked the magical presence to something hidden behind a wall or bookcase, but couldnâ€™t figure out how to access it. Eventually, she sat down at Greystoneâ€™s desk, fiddling with everything she could find.

## **Session 11: The Magic Unravels**

#### **Ruby's Encounter with Fear**

Ruby, ever the daring adventurer, had broken into the office of Lord Halen Greystone, determined to uncover the magical signature hidden behind the bookcase. She began her search methodically, sitting in Lord Greystoneâ€™s chair, fiddling with various objects, hoping to discover a secret switch. Frustrated, she decided to pull each book from the shelves. When her hand reached a small, black, untitled book, everything changed.

A magical trap was triggered, and it invaded her mind. Ruby suddenly found herself gripped by fear, convinced that soldiers of the Dynasty were outside the office searching for her. In her panic, she hid behind a sofa, consumed with thoughts of escaping.

#### **Abokarâ€™s Inquiry at the Temple**

Meanwhile, Abokar was at the temple, speaking with the monks after Mila had been healed by Brother Eldon. Having finished his conversation with Faragrim, he turned to an elderly monk to ask if this temple had ever been referred to as "The Lighthouse." The monk, puzzled, informed Abokar that he had never heard the temple of the Lady of Luck described that way.

As the day progressed, Rono, Boris the butler, and Halen Greystone returned to the mansion, while Huxley, Nickolas, and Abokar followed shortly afterward.

#### **Idris Cleans the Lab**

In another part of the estate, Idris was busy cleaning up the chaos he had caused in the lab and storeroom. Despite the damage, he managed to restore the area to an even cleaner state than before. Viola had escorted Lia, the maid, back downstairs and heard Halenâ€™s return. Preparing for the inevitable confrontation, she went outside to warn him. 

There was a brief moment of confusion when Boris revealed the massive two-handed axe strapped to his back, but to everyoneâ€™s relief, there was no need for a fight. 

Halen found Idris just as he finished cleaning and, though he appreciated the effort, he informed Idris that the 100 gold piece reward would be withheld to cover the cost of repairing the damage.

#### **Rubyâ€™s Flight and Return**

Curiosity piqued, Halen asked about Ruby. Noticing his office door had been forced open, he opened it only to see Ruby, terrified, dart past him and Boris. Boris attempted to grab her but missed, tackling Halen to the ground instead. Ruby ran out of the front door, shouting about the Dynasty, with Idris sprinting after her on all fours, and a winded Rono not far behind.

Viola, sensing the danger, took cover in a nearby alley while Idris and Rono ran into Abokar, Huxley, and Nickolas. After explaining the situation, the group searched for Ruby but eventually returned to the mansion empty-handed.

#### **The Hum Dust Experiment**

Ruby eventually returned, and the group gathered in Halenâ€™s lab. Though no charges were pressed, both Ruby and Idris lost their promised reward. The party shifted focus back to their experiment involving the mysterious "Hum Dust."

Viola meticulously recorded Halenâ€™s findings, while Nickolas prevented Idris from causing distractions. Ruby lent her arcane knowledge, and Halen guided the team. Together, they discovered that the Hum Dust seemed to be part of a new, chaotic school of magic that "unraveled" things, breaking them down.

#### **Securing the Hum Dust**

With their findings in hand, the group discussed the dangers of keeping the Hum Dust. Halen expressed his reluctance to store it, given how dangerous and useless it was to him. After much deliberation, they decided to hide the real Hum Dust and perhaps create a decoy.

They painted the container black to conceal it, and Ruby took responsibility for keeping it safe.

#### **Viola Learns the Truth**

Later, Halen pulled Viola aside to share something profound. Arnoud, a dear friend who had passed away from old age, had asked Halen to reveal certain truths to her after his death. Lord Greystone explained that Arnoud had spent his final years researching magical disturbances and curses that plagued specific families and groups. Viola, along with the others, had been gathered for more than just one purposeâ€”partly for the mystery of the Hum Dust, but also for another, deeper reason.

Halen had taken notice of Rubyâ€™s arcane abilities, Idrisâ€™ recent arrival from Xhorhas, and Abokarâ€™s connection to the Ravagers. He also suspected that Ronoâ€™s ties to Whitestone and Nickolas' connections to the university in Emon could prove valuable. Halen believed fate had drawn them all together. Disturbing similarities in magical phenomena were occurring in Xhorhas, Syngorn, and among the Ravagersâ€”chaos that seemed intertwined with madness and magic.

Halen confessed that he had brought this group together with the hope that they might help Viola, should she choose to continue Arnoudâ€™s research.

Viola took the revelation with quiet frustration, struggling to understand why Arnoud had spent his final years so consumed by this research instead of enjoying life. Halen reassured her that Arnoud had found joy in his work, and though he had passed away, he had entrusted her with the knowledge he had accumulated. Halen emphasized that he had no expectations, only that he had fulfilled Arnoudâ€™s final request by sharing the truth with her.

#### **Viola's Grief and Healing**

Overcome with emotion, Viola left the mansion, retrieving her gold before heading to Arnoudâ€™s home. There, she unleashed her grief, destroying much of the furniture in a fit of rage. But soon, sadness overtook her, and she set out to repair the damage she had done. 

While walking through town, she noticed children playing with a doll, and in a brief, cathartic moment, she grabbed the doll and handed it to one of the children, before they ran off, laughing and playing again. 

Viola managed to fix most of the damage she had caused, though a small pile of broken furniture remained untouched.

#### **Abokar Seeks Help**

While Viola was with Halen, Abokar shared his personal struggles with the group. He explained that something strange had happened to him and his dwarven brothers during the war, and now he sought answers. Huxley, overhearing the conversation, mentioned that the city would fund a mercenary group to travel to the Silvercut Crossroads for 200 gold pieces each. Given the rising tensions with the Ravagers in the area, Abokarâ€™s intent to travel there aligned with the city's needs.

The group agreed to help Abokar, each for their own reasons. Before leaving, Boris delivered a private message from Viola to Idris, encouraging him to never lose his curiosity. Boris, unsure of the messageâ€™s full meaning, simply relayed it as given.

#### **An Unraveled Evening**

As the session drew to a close, Viola sat in the quiet house of Arnoud, waiting for darkness to fall. Meanwhile, Abokar and Ruby headed to Abokarâ€™s house as the streets grew darker. Rono and Idris, in search of excitement, decided to try their luck at the Maiden's Wish casino, despite Huxleyâ€™s nervous suggestion to pick a different establishment.

## **Session 12: Storms of Fate and Shadows in the Night**

### **Night has begun, and the group is split**

A massive thunderstorm rolls over the mountains west of Kymal, casting the city in sheets of rain and deep, booming thunder. The casino district bustles with new patrons seeking refuge and excitement amidst the storm. Among them are Idris and Rono, who head to the Maidenâ€™s Wish Casino, eager to finally experience the allure of Kymalâ€™s grandest establishment after an intense few days.

Meanwhile, Viola, emotionally drained from a difficult conversation about her servant Arnoud, retreats to her home. Feeling a gnawing hunger, she takes her newly acquired gold and heads to the Ladies of Pleasure. Ruby and Abokar retire to Abokar's home to spend the evening discussing their pasts. Nickolas returns to The Muddy Boot Inn, where he drafts letters to Emon and the Talâ€™Dorei Council, voicing concerns over the corruption and actions of the town guards.

### **Violaâ€™s Night**

Through the pouring rain, Viola enters an establishment where the sounds of pleasure mingle with the heavy scents of perfume and incense. She hands over two gold pieces to the matron and is shown to a room with two companions for the night. Viola surprises them by giving each an additional gold piece with a peculiar request: she wishes for them to remain silent and roleplay as if she were a mother soothing them to sleep. Although confused, the two women agree, and as the thunder crashes outside, they eventually fall asleep. Viola is left alone to do as she pleases until her own contentment is reached.

### **Idris and Rono at the Casino**

Idris stops by Viola's home in Kymal, but finding no one there, he and Rono brave the storm to reach the opulent Maidenâ€™s Wish Casino. The warmth, the music, and the lively crowd immediately envelop them as they exchange 10 gold each for special casino chips embossed with "The Maidenâ€™s Wish" and the symbol of the Lady of Luck. The crowd quickly separates the two, each embarking on his own adventure.

Idris takes in the vibrant atmosphere, noting the variety of games, the central bar, and the guards positioned strategically around the room. Near the bar, a cluster of important-looking figures gathers around an unknown individual. Idris decides to reach out to the spirits and, seated at a large table, discreetly performs a ritual with a skull in his lap. His vision reveals a scene in the back rooms where a cheater is captured and killedâ€”not by the guards, but by a separate, more ruthless militia under the casino ownerâ€™s orders.

As Idris comes out of his trance, he finds himself face-to-face with Calis Krishtan, the casinoâ€™s flamboyant owner, who witnessed the ritual and is thoroughly delighted. With grandiose gestures and a booming voice, Calis demands a larger spectacle for his guests. A table is cleared, and before Idris fully realizes it, he is pushed onto the tabletop with a growing crowd around him, waiting in eager anticipation.

Thinking quickly, Idris requests a volunteer, and Calis points to a guest at random. The man, terrified, is shoved onto the table by Calisâ€™s bouncers, but he promptly faints. Growing impatient, Calis suggests one of his own bouncers, and the performance begins. Idris speeds up his movements, attempting a high-energy display, but the small tabletop limits his routine, giving it an awkward appearance. Still, he conjures fireworks and summons spirits to enter his volunteer, who stares blankly at first but finally collapses into hysterical laughter for a few moments.

Unfortunately, Calis is momentarily distracted, missing the climax of Idrisâ€™s act. When he turns back to see his unimpressed bouncer and a sweaty Idris, he is sorely disappointed. Calling Idris a charlatan, he has him thrown out of the casino, declaring heâ€™d wasted a rare opportunity.

### **Theft at Abokarâ€™s House**

As rain lashes against the windows, Ruby and Abokar shelter in his cozy basement, where an alchemical lab and smithy bear traces of blood from Abokarâ€™s experiments. Abokar, after cleaning up, offers Ruby his bed and prepares to sleep on the floor, barricading the door with a cabinet as Ruby recounts her past. She reveals how her brother, Essek, jealous of her magical talents, framed her, leading to her banishment from the Kryn Dynasty. She further divulges a closely guarded secretâ€”that the queen suffers from Typhros, a madness-inducing illness unknown to most. Ruby has been pursued across Exandria by the Aurora Watch ever since.

Later in the night, Abokar wakes suddenly, sensing something amiss. Pretending to sleep, he listens, and soon hears the faint creak of a nearby door. He bolts up and collides with something invisible, attempting to grapple it. A struggle ensues, and the intruder manages to slip out of a window, just as Abokar glimpses an outline in the rain. Rushing to the window, he finds no trace of the intruder, who vanished into the storm.

Ruby, alarmed, begins checking her possessions. To her horror, she discovers a vital bottle of hum dustâ€”crucial and irreplaceableâ€”has been stolen. Despite their exhaustion, they race through the mud-soaked streets to The Muddy Boot Inn.

### **Partial Regroup at The Muddy Boot Inn**

At the inn, Lisa admits Ruby and Abokar, who anxiously hurry upstairs to ensure Nickolas is safe. Though disturbed by the theft, theyâ€™re relieved to find him undisturbed. The list of those aware of the hum dustâ€™s significance is short, and suspicion briefly falls on Idris until he arrives, soaking wet after his abrupt departure from the casino. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the group decides to visit Lord Halen Greystoneâ€™s manor without delay.

### **The Fight at Greystone Manor**

Arriving at the rain-soaked courtyard of Greystone Manor, Abokar hears rustling in a walled-off garden. Under the pretense of seeking privacy, he heads toward the noise. Moments later, heâ€™s ambushed but swiftly turns to catch his assailant by surprise. The intruder attempts to flee, only to stumble straight into Ruby, Nickolas, and Idris, who use both magic and swift maneuvers to subdue him. Though restrained and bruised, the figure continues to struggle against their grip, hinting that the fight is far from over.

## **Session 14: Uncovering Something Bigger**

### **Moving the Prisoner**

The group gathered in the barn of Lord Greystone's estate, surrounded by horses and a carriage. They deliberated on how to transport the 'little girl,' a shape-shifting creature of unknown origin, to a safer location. The caves housing the alchemist's lab were deemed the best option. Boris took the reins of the carriage and drove the group to the site before returning the vehicle to maintain appearances. Meanwhile, Captain Huxley and his guards resolved to protect the mansion through the night.

### **A Challenging Stairway**

The storm raged on, and heavy rainfall turned the descent to the alchemist's lab into a treacherous ordeal. The group navigated a steep staircase cut into the cliffside, down from a sewer grate. Water cascaded into the darkness below, threatening to sweep away anyone who lost their footing. Ropes and teamwork proved vital as the group descended safely. Once inside, they searched the lab for signs of intrusion since their last visit.

### **A Creepy Night**

The group fortified the lab with makeshift traps and alarms. Abokar rigged a noisemaking device using ropes and his hammer, while Ruby crafted magical wards to sound alerts. Idris, in a stroke of creativity, placed the unconscious creature under a bench, reasoning that any sudden movement would alert them â€”and it did. During their watch, the creature stirred, hitting its head on the bench and alerting both guards.

What followed was unnerving. The creature stared at Abokar before morphing into his likeness, smirking and silent. It reverted to the form of a little girl but with a disturbingly wide smile and canine-like head movements that unsettled Idris, who promptly knocked it unconscious again.

The rest of the night passed uneventfully until the final watch, when the creature awoke once more.

### **Viola Pluntard**

Elsewhere in the city, Viola woke up in a house of pleasure, sharing the bed with two companions. Unbothered, she enjoyed a leisurely breakfast, observing and eavesdropping on the patrons. She caught whispers about the unexpected closure of the casino *The Wishing Well*, a first in over two decades. The gossip linked the closure to *The Clasp*, rumored to operate covertly through the casino.

Viola set out to leave the city, seeking a caravan for the journey. Initially, her fine attire deterred most mercenary groups, wary of the dangers posed by ravagers, orcs, and goblins. Demonstrating her ability to transform into a massive beast, Viola quickly gained their interest. She was invited to join a seasoned caravan heading north to Westruun. It would wait for her, until the evening.

### **The Truth and Nothing but the Truth**

Back in the lab, the creature had begun shifting into the likeness of each group member, mocking them with exaggerated impressions. Nickolas, determined to get answers, cast *Zone of Truth*. The magic momentarily revealed the creatureâ€™s true form: a long, gray, alien-like entity with unsettlingly dark purple eyes marked by concentric circles. It shifted quickly back into one of their forms, but the eyes remained purple with circles.

Bound by the spell, the creature taunted the group, speaking cryptically about forces far beyond their comprehension. It described them as "children playing on the shoreline of a great ocean," oblivious to the titanic battles raging beyond their view. It spoke of an anvil and a smith ready to reshape the world, blaming "Hum Dust" and its brother in Stilben for obstructing its mission.

When questioned about *The Clasp*, it mockingly transformed into the Margrave, Calis Krishtan, laughing boisterously. On the topic of lighthouses or the daughter mentioned in a note, it admitted ignorance. Its primary goal was to remove the "stupid dust" disrupting its work. When asked about its identity, it deflected, claiming it could be anyone.

The relentless mockery wore down Rono's patience. Enraged, he drew his weapon and shot the creature, killing it.

### **The Failsafe**

As the creature died, its form shifted into that of a little girl, sticking out its tongue in defiance before reverting to its true alien form. The group noticed a tattoo on its body: concentric purple circles filled with glowing runes and glyphs. Ruby identified the markings as part of a magical failsafe. The glyphs ignited, consuming the body to summon a chaotic beast.

The summoned entity defied nature, constantly shifting formsâ€”growing heads, tentacles, and eyes, transforming into fire, ice, and sand in a surreal display. The group engaged in a fierce battle, enduring significant damage before finally defeating the creature. When it fell, it vanished entirely, leaving no trace except for the destruction it caused.

In the aftermath, the silence was deafening, an ominous reminder that the nightâ€™s horrors may only be the beginning of something much greater.

## **Session 13: The Shape Shifter**

### **The Fight at Greystone Manor**

In the rain-slicked courtyard of Greystone Manor, thunder cracked, and lightning illuminated fleeting glimpses of the ongoing struggle. The group wrestled with a shadowy figure, slapping a pair of cuffs onto the thiefâ€™s wrists. But their foe was nimble, slipping free with practiced easeâ€”only to be outmaneuvered by Nickolas, who quickly produced another set of manacles. The group redoubled their efforts and secured the thief once more.  

Seizing the opportunity, Ruby searched the thief and triumphantly recovered her stolen bottle of hum dust, confirming this was the same culprit from earlier that evening. The thiefâ€™s mask was removed, revealing a face as unfamiliar as it was untrustworthy.  

Their victory, however, was interrupted. From the sheets of rain and darkness emerged a commanding figureâ€”Lord Greystone himself, his voice cutting through the chaos like a blade.  

### **Lord Greystone?**

Furious at the commotion outside his manor so late at night, Lord Greystone demanded an explanation. He ordered the group to remove the thief from his property but paused, eyeing the hum dust in Rubyâ€™s possession. With an authoritative tone, he argued the dust was too dangerous for them to handle, insisting it be locked away safely within his mansion.  

The group hesitated, unease creeping into their ranks. Something felt wrong. His sudden change of heart was out of character, and the tension rose as accusations and arguments flew. Rono, his instincts sharp as ever, drew his weapon and leveled it at the lord.  

### **Boris Intervenes**

From the manorâ€™s shadows, Boris, the ever-vigilant butler, emerged. Hearing the raised voices, he had sought out Mia, who confirmed Lord Greystone had been in his chambers not long ago. Realizing the deception, Boris stormed into the rain, wielding his massive two-handed axe. His fury was palpable as he confronted the impersonator.  

Despite the heated standoff, no one dared to strike first. The stalemate provided the thief with a moment of fortune. With astonishing skill, he slipped free of the cuffs and unleashed a sphere of magical darkness. Chaos erupted.  

### **A Chaotic Escape**

In the impenetrable blackness, the thief fled, evading their grasp despite a few lucky strikes that grazed him. As the darkness dissipated, the groupâ€™s attention snapped to another fleeing figureâ€”Boris himself, sprinting through the streets.  

Realizing the impossibility of the situation, the group gave chase. The imposter, a shape-shifter, found its cunning outmatched by the groupâ€™s teamwork. With a combination of spells and sheer determination, they incapacitated the creature, leaving it laughing uncontrollably on the cobblestones.  

Meanwhile, the real Boris stood steadfast at the manorâ€™s entrance, ensuring the group outside remained under scrutiny.  

### **The Shapeshifterâ€™s True Form**

Surrounded and out of options, the creature abandoned its guise as Boris. Before their eyes, it shifted into the form of a crying seven-year-old girl. Its wails echoed through the rain-soaked streets, flickering lanterns coming alive in nearby windows as curious neighbors stirred.  

The transformation was unsettling, revealing glimpses of a strange, gray material beneath its skin during the shift. Abokar, unshaken by the theatrics, hoisted the creature onto his shoulder and carried it back to the manor.  

### **The Real Lord Greystone**

From a window above, the true Lord Greystone watched the scene unfold. With Borisâ€™s urging and the groupâ€™s explanation, he retrieved an emergency scroll and summoned the captain of the guard. He offered the group sanctuary but ultimately agreed with Boris that it was safer for them to take shelter in the barn, away from the mansion proper.  

### **Interrogation and Rest**

Safe but weary, the group attempted to interrogate the creature, receiving only the pitiful cries of a frightened child in response. Frustrated, Abokar resorted to drastic measures, cutting off one of its fingers. The creature howled in pain before losing consciousness. The blood seemed disturbingly real, and the group was left questioning the nature of their captive.  

Drained from the long day, some members of the group seized the chance to rest while others kept watch.  

### **Huxleyâ€™s Arrival**

The arrival of Huxley, drenched and flanked by heavily armored guards, brought fresh tension. Though visibly exhausted, he listened as the group explained the childâ€™s true nature. Among its possessions, they discovered Liaâ€™s blade, stolen from the maid of the house, and a coin bearing the mark of The Claspâ€™s highest ranks.  

Rubyâ€™s ritual confirmed the coinâ€™s magical properties: a sending spell, usable once per dayâ€”a powerful artifact in the wrong hands.  

As the storm raged on, the group stood with their bound and unconscious prisoner, exhausted but resolute, bracing themselves for what the morning might bring.

## **Session 15: To The Smithy**

### **The Aftermath in the Lab**

Abokar, Nickolas, Ruby, Idris, and Rono stood amidst the remnants of their recent battle, attempting to piece together the events that had transpired. The original creature had disintegrated, leaving behind only ashes, while its counterpart had vanished entirely.

Abokar expressed doubts about the entity's demise, puzzled by its nonchalant attitude toward its own end. Nickolas noted that, in his experience, cultists often exhibited similar behavior. Abokar countered, suggesting such actions typically serve a greater cause, leaving the unsettling question: How did this further its cause?

Ruby cast *Detect Magic*, revealing a dissipating cloud of conjuration magic. As the group took a brief respite, Abokar unexpectedly experienced an old wound reopening.

Resolving to proceed with their initial plan, they set their sights on the Silvercut Crossroads to investigate Abokar's situation and the Ravagers. Recognizing the need for provisions and information, they decided to head to the market.

### **Matters at the Manor**

Viola navigated the slick, rain-soaked streets to Lord Greystone's manor, the morning market bustling around her. Upon arrival, she overheard Boris, Greystone's butler, reprimanding a young messenger for failing to locate her. As Boris noticed Viola's approach, he dismissed the boy saying he had found Viola himself now.

Viola insisted on speaking with Lord Greystone. Boris explained that the manor had been attacked the previous night by a shape-shifting creature impersonating both Lord Greystone and himself. To verify her identity, he requested confidential information, but Viola curtly reminded him of the private note she had entrusted to him the day before. Satisfied, Boris led her to Lord Greystone, cautioning her to remain quiet as Huxley was resting.

Inside, Lord Greystone had converted the waiting room into a makeshift office. Upon seeing Viola, he gave her his full attention. Viola confronted him about meddling in her family's affairs, expressing her offense. Greystone clarified that he had been a close friend of Arnaud and had merely assisted with his research, providing resources and a secure location. He then handed Viola a bundle containing the entirety of the project and research, bound in leather.

### **Grave Requests and Warnings**

Greystone emphasized that his involvement was solely to honor Arnaud's dying wish to inform Viola, the last known survivor. During their conversation, he expressed concern for her safety, noting the recent attack and the absence of Lia, who hadn't returned home. He also mentioned a group of adventurers who had departed with the shape-shifting creature and timidly requested Viola's assistance in ensuring everyone's well-being, offering payment for her efforts.

Viola stood, suggesting that any payment be considered 'hush money,' and warned Greystone against discussing the research with others, implying dire consequences. Unfazed, Greystone returned to his work as Viola departed, heading toward the grate leading to the secret lab.

### **An Awkward Reunion**

As Abokar, Nickolas, Ruby, Idris, and Rono made their way to the market, they spotted Viola ahead. They inquired about her whereabouts, with Idris mentioning a visit to her home that yielded no answers. Viola responded defensively, asserting that her personal life was her own concern and that her involvement with them had concluded with the completion of their previous job.

Abokar, suspicious, explained the recent attack involving a shape-shifting creature connected to a larger scheme. Listening intently, Viola eventually disclosed that she had spent the night elsewhere and had arranged to join a trade caravan heading north. While she intended to travel beyond the Silvercut Crossroads, she agreed to accompany the group for that portion of the journey. When pressed about her reasons for traveling further north, Viola remained guarded, redirecting the focus to the necessary preparations for their journey.

### **The Market**

The party navigated Kymal's bustling market, acquiring essential gear and supplies. Abokar sought books on alchemy but found only texts on cave mushrooms and poison concoctions, which didn't meet his needs. Ruby's search for magical literature yielded only fantasy and romance novels with tangential mentions of magic. Rono purchased one of these stories for leisure reading during downtime.

### **The Fox's Fancy**

At the Fox's Fancy, Abokar collected a custom-made wooden cane with a bear-shaped handle, paying an additional two silver without hesitation.

Ruby and Rono entered the Fox's Fancy to escape another tense exchange between Viola and the group. The enthusiastic half-elven shopkeeper eagerly showcased her wooden sculptures. Ruby inquired about high-quality charcoal and a reputable place for metalwork. The shopkeeper provided an address and the name Faragrim. For the charcoal, she returned with a basket of low-grade pieces from her furnace. Mistaking the quality as superior, Ruby purchased it for two gold.

Rono, recognizing the deception, attempted to intimidate the shopkeeper into returning the gold. Unimpressed, she mistook his weapon for a metal sculpture and tried to sell him a similar wooden dragon carving. Distracted, Rono placed his gun on the counter to examine the statue, then left without paying to compensate for Ruby's loss.

Outside, Ruby questioned the whereabouts of Rono's pistol. Panicked, Rono rushed back inside to find the shopkeeper had picked up the firearm and accidentally discharged it, causing a loud bang and a hole in the wall. He quickly retrieved his pistol and exited.

The group, alerted by the noise, saw Rono emerge hastily before seeing the shopkeep quickly lock the door and turn a sign saying "closed".

### **Faragrimâ€™s Smithy**

The group approached Faragrimâ€™s smithy, greeted by the rhythmic clanging of metal on metal. Inside, a sturdy dwarf, shirt stained with blood and sweat, was immersed in his craft. Abokar recognized him instantly, and the two shared a warriorâ€™s embraceâ€”equal parts respect and camaraderie. Faragrim paused his work, wiped his brow, and turned his attention to the party.

â€œWhat can I do for you lot?â€ Faragrim asked, his voice like gravel warmed by a hearty fire.

The group quickly got to business, trading and bartering for equipment. Shields were exchanged, armor was fitted, and manaclesâ€”because every adventurer apparently needs a fewâ€”were purchased. Abokar eyed a set of splint armor, but Faragrim admitted he didnâ€™t have it in stock. â€œGive me a few hours, and Iâ€™ll pull some strings. Might cost you a bit extra, though,â€ Faragrim offered with a knowing grin. Abokar agreed, rolling up his sleeves to help forge some special bullets for Rono while they waited.

### **A Forge Under Strain**

Idris pitched in with the bellows, Abokar hammered out bullets, and Faragrim worked his connections to secure the splint armor. By early afternoon, the smithy was filled with the smell of sweat, metal, and the faintest whiff of dwarven pride. However, amidst the hard work, it became apparent that Faragrim was struggling.

Similar to Abokar, Faragrim was suffering from old war wounds mysteriously reopening and then miraculously healing againâ€”but his condition was far worse. At one point, the strain and blood loss became very obvious, and Idris and Nickolas rushed to his aid, casting healing magic to help him. Without their intervention, Faragrim might have collapsed entirely from the relentless toll his body was taking.

Faragrim, grateful yet embarrassed, acted as if it wasn't as bad as it looks, worried what people might say about him otherwise. Despite his ordeal, he continued to forge ahead with the determination of a seasoned warrior.

### **Ritual and Research**

Meanwhile, Ruby and Rono ventured to a nearby temple, where Ruby sweet-talked the priests into parting with a small brazier. Ruby performed a ceremony that left Ronoâ€™s jaw hanging. â€œSir Cheeky,â€ Rubyâ€™s flying squirrel familiar, reappeared, chittering cheerfully.

Nickolas and Viola, opting for a quieter afternoon, stayed near the smithy. Nickolas respected Violaâ€™s guarded nature, keeping his focus on the street and indulging in a bit of people-watching. Viola, however, turned her attention to the leather-bound research bundle Greystone had given her. As she skimmed through the notes, her guarded expression shifted to one of growing concern.

The manuscript was a chilling tapestry of curses, madness, and corruption. It detailed the descent of her family from noble intentions to selfish ambitions, the ripple effects of their actions leaving destruction in their wake. The research also touched on cycles of madness tied to the Ravagers in Kymal and similar phenomena affecting the royal lines of the Krynn Dynasty. Pages of scratched-out notes detailed curses, diseases, and magical maladies, but it was the final page that caused Viola to pause.

Her nameâ€”along with the names of her companionsâ€”was listed, each tied to a section of the research. Abokar: linked to the Ravagers. Ruby and Idris: tied to Xhorhas and the Krynn. Rono: connected to Whitestone. Nickolas Adastra: his last name circled repeatedly, tied to a page on magical maladies and cursed artifacts. Halfway through, the handwriting shifted from Arnaudâ€™s to Greystoneâ€™sâ€”a detail Viola couldnâ€™t ignore.

### **The Wishing Well**

The group reunited and Abokar proposed investigating the Wishing Well, a casino rumored to have ties to The Clasp. Upon arrival, they found it shuttered, the front door locked tight. Curious onlookers whispered among themselves, their gossip carrying tales of strange happenings within. A faint shout from inside piqued the groupâ€™s curiosity further.

After a quick scout of the perimeter, Idris grew impatient. With a dramatic flourish, he lobbed a rock through a window. Nickolas tried to assert some semblance of order, flashing his council badge in an attempt to disperse the crowd. Predictably, this had the opposite effectâ€”because in Kymal, nothing draws a crowd like a bit of chaos.

The group clambered through the broken window, Abokar using his trusty crowbar, Betsy, to pry open an inner door. Inside, the casino was eerily quiet, save for the faint echoes of a heated argument emanating from somewhere below. They crept closer, catching snippets of a tense exchange:

â€œThat thing was NOT Liaâ€”it deceived us all!â€

â€œWe have to undo all the decisions she made, somehow.â€

â€œHow? Most of us are gone or in hiding! And what about those adventurers? Theyâ€™re tangled up in this mess!â€

The group exchanged glances, the weight of the unknown settling over them like a heavy fog.

## **Session 16: The Wishing Well**

### **Breaking In**

The group infiltrated the Wishing Well Casino by smashing a side window and prying open a door with Abokar's trusty crowbar, Betsy. Inside, they entered the grand two-story casino, dominated by a towering glass maze resembling a hall of mirrors, suspended over metal grates. Echoing voices drifted from below, hinting at hidden activity. Sensing urgency, Viola and Idris decided to act. Idris hurled a rock at the maze wall, causing a loud crack that silenced the voices. Idris briefly caught the sound of scuffling and a rock scraping against stone.

### **Splitting Up**

The party divided to cover more ground. Abokar discovered a massive iron chain descending through a hole in the floor and vanishing into a cramped shaft beneath the maze. Unable to follow it below, he decided to trace it upstairs. Ruby found a staircase leading to a balcony overlooking the maze. Suspended above the labyrinth were four wooden rigs holding bucketsâ€”three filled with water, one glinting with gold. Meanwhile, Nickolas and Rono uncovered a series of levers behind the bar and a heavy, reinforced door. Viola, determined to find the source of the voices, ventured outside.

### **Navigating the Maze**

Ruby's discovery of the gold-filled bucket piqued Idris's interest. To Viola's frustration, Idris abandoned the chase to navigate the maze. With Ruby's shouted guidance, he stumbled through the glass corridors, occasionally smacking into walls. Eventually, Idris reached the bucket. Recognizing that tipping it would spill the coins through the grate, he deftly climbed the glass walls and cut the bucket free, securing about 50 gold pieces. As he prepared to leave, the glass beneath him shifted, causing him to slip. A rising glass panel struck him in the face, leaving him bruised.

### **The Chain Mechanism**

Abokar ascended to the first floor, locating a heavy iron door. Betsy once again proved invaluable, prying it open to reveal a towering chamber. Suspended near the ceiling, a colossal boulder hung from thick iron chains. A ship-like wheel nearby controlled the chains. Curious, Abokar turned the wheel, causing the boulder to inch upward until it reached its peak. Satisfied but wary, he turned to leave when the entire mechanism groaned to lifeâ€”the boulder began its slow descent as massive gears clanked into motion.

### **The Storeroom and Traps**

Nickolas and Rono breached the reinforced door, revealing a storeroom stocked with food and drink. Hidden among crates, Nickolas discovered a trapdoor. Attempting to open it triggered a deadly trapâ€”spears shot down from the ceiling, narrowly missing them. Ruby joined them but was more interested in stuffing her bag of holding with supplies than solving puzzles.

### **The Levers in Action**

Rono theorized the levers behind the bar controlled the hatch. Experimenting, he pulled them, causing the entire building to tremble. Gears whirred, and the glass maze shifted, transforming into a new configuration. This startled Abokar and resulted in Idris taking the painful hit from moving glass. Yet, the hatch remained locked.

### **Viola's Discovery**

Outside, Viola tried rallying the gathering crowd, but only two eager teens offered to help. Scanning the area, she noticed a shadowy figure reflected in the water at the bottom of the nearby well. Summoning a small spirit, she confirmed an expansive chamber beneath. Sending the teens off with a cryptic message for Lord Greystone, Viola hurried back inside.

### **Pressure and Decisions**

Viola arrived just as Rono shot open the hatch. She urged the group to explore the well's depths, but Abokar had already charged down the hatch. Torn between options, the group followed Abokar, leaving Viola trailing behind.

### **Face to Face with Danger**

The underground storeroom was crammed with mechanical parts, chains, and glass panels. Racing ahead, Abokar nearly ran into a massive gelatinous cube. It attacked, engulfing him and causing severe acid burns. Nickolas cleverly used a chair to block another cube. After a fierce battle, the group defeated the creatures, salvaging partially digested documents from the ooze.

### **Hidden Paths**

Determined to uncover their quarry's escape route, the group began smashing through sections of the glass maze, focusing on walls near the well. Idris eventually stumbled upon a hidden lever in the storeroom, revealing a concealed passage. The group quickly followed, entering a dust-choked, claustrophobic tunnel system. Viola voiced her confusion about how their quarry had used the hidden lever without leaving obvious signs. Ruby speculated that a strategically placed crate had been used to disguise the lever.

### **A Deadly Trap**

Rono, overhearing Ruby and Idris debating through the thin walls, decided to pull the lever again. This time, it swung open a hidden door and silently armed a deadly trap. As Viola stepped forward, the ground gave way beneath her feet. She barely managed to leap back in time, narrowly avoiding a pit lined with vicious, upward-pointing spears. The group froze, staring down into the dark, deadly trap.

### **Definitely Just a Chest, Not a Mimic**

In the depths, Idris attempted to unlock a chest, only to be ensnared by a mimic. Ruby intervened, shielding him from the creature's gnashing maw. The group swiftly dispatched the mimic, recovering a few gold pieces and two healing potions.

### **The Chase Continues Through the Sewers**

Pressing on, the group emerged into Kymalâ€™s sewers. Tracking footprints beneath the marketplace, they realized the well above drained into the sewers. They reached a nexus where four sets of tracks diverged into separate tunnels. Abokar led them down the heaviest trail, while Ruby doubled back to retrieve Viola. Together again, they steeled themselves to pursue their quarry into the dark depths.

## **Session 17: Tracking Down a Bear**

### **The Flooded Sewers**

The storm had turned the sewers into a chaotic, rushing torrent, the echoes of water cascading through the tunnels making conversation difficult. Violaâ€™s summoned flying spirit flitted ahead, its glow barely cutting through the oppressive darkness. They pressed forward, following the clearest set of muddy tracks they could find, leading them to a narrow, treacherous bridge slick with grime.

Ruby took the initiative, crossing first with deft precision, while Viola shifted into her giant spider form to ferry Abokar and Nickolas across. Idris, ever resourceful, dug his fingers into the cracks of the ancient stone, clawing his way across. The bridge held, but the tension in the air was palpable.

---

### **The Rot Grubs**

In a fetid corner of the tunnel, the group stumbled upon a grotesque tableauâ€”a cluster of corpses fused to the wall, writhing with maggots. Viola, still in her spider form, cautiously shot a web at the mass. But as her silk struck the bodies, the maggots surged, spilling toward the group in a relentless tide.  

Abokar was the first target, but his resilience held. Viola wasnâ€™t so fortunate. The grubs burrowed into her spider form, tearing through her body until her giant arachnid frame collapsed. Desperation took hold as she shifted into her bear form, only for the infestation to continue. The group scrambled to save her, using spells like *Turn Undead* and *Prestidigitation*, and even attempting crude surgery, but nothing seemed to work.  

As the grubs neared Violaâ€™s vital organs, Ruby, Idris, and Abokar realized they were fighting an infection, not just creatures. With no time to waste, they lit a fire and seared the wounds, driving the grubs out in a frenzy. Viola roared in pain, but the burning workedâ€”the parasites shriveled and died, leaving her battered but alive.

---

### **Clues in the Sewers**

After patching themselves up, the party pressed on, finding a rusted gate leading into a forgotten tunnel choked with cobwebs. Ruby sent her flying squirrel to scout, but the path ahead remained shrouded in mystery. Nearby, a storm surge grate caught their attention, bearing a scrap of cloth. Investigating further, they uncovered a pile of oversized clothes, including a massive cloak made from bear fur.  

The tracks continued, leading them out of the sewers and into the town above.

---

### **The Stakeout**

The muddy trail led to an unremarkable house tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. The group took a cautious approach, staking out the area from a distance. A local family confirmed that a â€œvery, very large half-orcâ€ lived there. The group noted the simplicity of the homes in the areaâ€”one-room dwellings, with no apparent connection to the Clasp.  

Rubyâ€™s flying squirrel slipped through a hole in the roof and spotted a gaunt man eating bread, surrounded by buckets. The house had no other visible exits.

---

### **The Bear**

After an hour of rest and planning, the group approached the house and knocked on the door. A massive half-orc opened it, his grin wide and welcomingâ€”until his eyes fell on the adventurers. He sighed heavily, his shoulders drooping in resignation.  

Abokar broke the awkward silence with a blunt remark: â€œWe found your clothes.â€  

The half-orcâ€™s laugh boomed through the quiet street, a deep belly laugh that seemed to echo endlessly. Viola, bristling with irritation, took it as mockery. Without warning, she hurled a rock at him in anger.  

The rock struck his chest with a dull thud, but it didnâ€™t faze him. Instead, he cocked his head and chuckled. â€œIf youâ€™re here to fight,â€ he said, â€œIâ€™m always up for a good brawl.â€  

Before the situation could escalate, the rest of the group stepped in to calm things down. The half-orc shrugged, stepped aside, and waved them in. â€œAlright, then,â€ he said. â€œCome in. Letâ€™s talk.â€

Inside, he gathered food and drinks, dragging together a mismatched set of chairs. â€œI reckon youâ€™ve got questions,â€ he said, settling into a chair that creaked under his weight. â€œBut Iâ€™ve got one too.â€

---

### **A Question of Lia**

The half-orcâ€™s jovial demeanor shifted as he leaned forward, his massive hands clasped in front of him. â€œWhere is Lia?â€ he asked. The question caught the adventurers off-guard. Viola narrowed her eyes. â€œYou donâ€™t know?â€  

He shook his head, his expression darkening. â€œIâ€™ve seen herâ€”but it wasnâ€™t her. Not really. Somethingâ€™s taken her over. Something *wrong.*â€  

The group shared a glance, unsure of what to say. When they suggested she might be dead, his growl rumbled low and menacing. â€œSheâ€™s not dead,â€ he insisted. â€œIf she were, Iâ€™d know. Sheâ€™s family.â€  

He spoke of Lia with deep reverence, describing her as the heart of the Clasp, a protector of the downtrodden. He condemned the recent actions of the organization under the imposterâ€™s leadershipâ€”assassinations, reckless operations, and betrayals of trust. â€œThatâ€™s not the Clasp,â€ he said, slamming his fist on the table. â€œThatâ€™s the Myriadâ€™s style.â€  

He revealed that she kept detailed records of all the Claspâ€™s connections and aid recipients, stored in her room at Greystone Manor. Itâ€™s the most secure spot in town.â€  

Tension simmered as Viola, still on edge, pressed him for more details. â€œWhat else do you know? Anything useful? What are her exact routines?â€  

The half-orc leaned back, a flicker of irritation crossing his face.

## **Session 18: Mirror Mirror On The Wall**

![4812347e-6adf-4703-988c-e076e4a87a7d](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/237d69d3-ed99-4604-859f-b8402973dfc1)

### **The Bear**

The Bearâ€”a half-orc whom the group had tracked from The Wishing Well Casinoâ€”explained that without The Clasp protecting the little man, Kymal would be in a far worse state. The margraveâ€™s strangehold on the city meant he cared only about squeezing out profits.

He revealed that their leader, Lia, had a secret book hidden in her room at Greystone Mansion. The book contained all the locations and names of those they had helped and who, in turn, helped them. The Clasp had noticed that Lia had stopped frequenting the Muddy Boot Inn in the evenings for a drink and some business. After about a week of absence, she reappearedâ€”but she never stayed long enough to speak with anyone, not even him.

This had happened a few weeks ago. He explained that Liaâ€™s orders had been sent to some of the more aggressive members of The Clasp, as well as to externally hired mercenaries, which made it difficult to spot the doppelganger impersonating her.

He wanted to hire the group to investigate and find Lia, for he believed she was still alive. At their request, he provided a code phrase to verify her identity: **"The City Drowns"** with the reply **"It is up to us to save it."**  
Ruby also persuaded the Bear to give her his magic ring in exchange for finding Liaâ€”and he agreed.

---

### **It's Quiet, Too Quiet**

The group returned to Greystone Manor, but when they arrived, no one answered the door. The mansion was eerily quiet. Abokar made a thorough walk-around and noticed that their cart and horses were still there, which suggested that the others hadnâ€™t left.

Nickolas tried the door, but it was locked. He insisted that no one should break inâ€”after all, doing so would be illegal without clear evidence of trouble. Viola, however, sensed something was amiss. She had left the manor only a few hours earlier, and everyone was present except for Lia.

Determined to investigate, Viola scoured the walls and peered into every window. Finding no signs of fighting, struggle, or people, she eventually broke an upstairs window, climbed inside, and then carefully mended it.

Meanwhile, Idris and Nickolas began arguing. Idris wanted to force entry and investigate further, but Nickolas fired his crossbow near Idrisâ€™s head to warn him against breaking in. Abokar, meanwhile, searched the streets for guards but found none nearby.

---

### **The Door Opens**

Suddenly, the front door swung open to reveal Viola, who had unlocked it from the inside with her key. Despite her return, Nickolas maintained that there was no cause to break in. During their continued discussion, Ruby swiftly released her pet squirrel insideâ€”just before Viola closed the door.

The sudden movement caused Idris to collide with the now-closed door. At the same time, Rubyâ€™s squirrel scurried upstairs. Seated on a bench, Ruby peered through the squirrelâ€™s eyes and noticed that one of the bedroom doors was partially open. The squirrel darted inside and began sniffing around; it climbed a clothing rack, glanced at the wallâ€”and in that moment, Rubyâ€™s vision went dark.

The last thing she saw was the reflection of Sir Squeeky, the squirrel. Nickolas decided to visit the captain of the guard, Huxley, to request backup if any guards were encountered along the way. Meanwhile, Viola also noticed the open door; she checked the room briefly and then slipped out through a window.

---

### **The Missing Squirrel**

Ruby recounted the strange incident with Sir Squeeky, prompting Idris to rush off. He scaled the side of the house via the window that Viola had used and forced his way inside. Noticing the partially open door, he investigated the room further.

The room appeared to have been ransackedâ€”clothes hung on a rackâ€”and on one wall, he spotted a mirror. Idris struck the mirror with a stick and suddenly saw the ghostly reflection of a floating, burning skull. This unnerved him, especially in light of Rubyâ€™s earlier account. He closed his eyes, removed the mirror from the wall, and carried it downstairs. Then he opened the front door and presented the strange mirror to the group.

---

### **The Mystery of the Mirror**

The group set the mirror aside, taking care never to look directly at its reflection. Meanwhile, Ruby carefully performed a magic identification ritual on it. Viola noticed some writing along the mirrorâ€™s frame and used parchment and charcoal to make an imprint so she could decipher it.

The inscription revealed two riddles:  
> â€œWhat crosses a river without moving?â€  
> â€œWhat knows all languages?â€

With her ritual complete, Ruby determined that they were dealing with a **Mirror of Trapping**. When activated with a key word, if someone looks directly at their reflection, they are sucked into one of twelve prison cells in a dimension of smoke. Furthermore, when a name is spoken before the mirror, that personâ€™s reflection appears, allowing for conversation. Uttering the number of a cell will reveal the creature contained within it.

---

### **Talking to Lia**

The group decided to suspend the mirror above the water in the fountain of the square outside the manor so that no one would see its reflections directly. They then summoned Lia and spoke with her.

At first, Lia suspected that a doppelganger was playing a trick on her, even warning that they would all die once she emerged. However, the group convinced her they were not in league with any impostorâ€”and that they had slain the doppelgangerâ€”using the previously provided code phrase.

They learned that Lia had been captured, though she didnâ€™t know for how long. A doppelganger had been impersonating herâ€”the only entity she could communicate with. While she kept most of The Claspâ€™s secrets to herself, she inadvertently revealed some details that aided the doppelganger. Desperate, she pleaded for help to be freed.

---

### **Checking All the Cells**

The group began inspecting the mirrorâ€™s prison cells. In the first cell, they found a floating, flaming skull that remained silent. The second cell contained a strange, ghostly, screaming specter. Lia was found in the third cell. In the fourth cell, they discovered Milaâ€”confused and terrified.

Boris was imprisoned in the fifth cell, aggressive and ready to fight. In the sixth cell, Halen Greystone explained that he had been searching for Mila and Borisâ€”who had mysteriously vanishedâ€”only to become trapped inside the mirror along with the rest of his staff. The seventh cell held a panicked Sir Squeeky. The remaining cells were empty.

---

### **Solving the Riddles (and the Guards Arrive)**

The group realized that destroying the mirror would force everything trapped within it to escape at onceâ€”which could lead to a dangerous confrontation. The alternative was to speak the name of a person preceded by the appropriate code word.

They set to work solving the riddles. They quickly deduced that **â€œBridgeâ€** was the code word needed to toggle the mirrorâ€™s function. However, finding the code word required to extract someone proved more challenging.

Before they could resolve it, guards rushed into the square. Nickolas had contacted Captain Huxley and then hastily departed. The bewildered guards attempted to arrest everyone present. After some confusionâ€”and perhaps persuasionâ€”a guard started shouting words that might solve the final riddle: â€œWhat knows all languages?â€  
Eventually, Abokar bellowed, â€œWhat!â€  
The answer, as it turned out, was simply **â€œWhatâ€**â€”because â€œWhat knows all languages?â€

Using the code word along with the names, the group managed to release everyone from the mirror. By that time, Nickolas had returned and was quickly brought up to speed.

---

### **Recuperating and Answers**

Everyone was grateful to have been freed. Mila, Boris, and Greystone were back at the manor, gathering in the kitchens for a drink to calm their nerves as they recounted the events. Lia explained how one day someone had managed to enter her room and hang the mirror upâ€”leaving her little time to react.

She admitted she knew nothing about the Hum Dust, except that the doppelganger grew furious whenever it was mentionedâ€”insisting that it be removed because it interfered with his own plans. He had been searching for a mysterious â€œshard,â€ yet the dust disrupted his detection methods. In his frustration, he had used The Claspâ€”with all its connections and wealthâ€”to try and find the source and eliminate it. Lia had tried to extract more information, but aside from mentioning a shard and that it was the last one they needed to locate, she knew no more.

---

### **The Rewards**

Abokar took the mirror home. After removing a dried sausage from the wall, he placed the mirror in his living room and activated it before departing for the South Gate of the city. Viola had explained that she had secured an agreement to ride alongside a caravan bound for Westruun.

The Silvercut Crossroads lay on the way, and Abokar asked the group to help him investigate thereâ€”especially since he and other survivors from the old Ravager battle were suffering from wounds that would unpredictably reopen and close.

Meanwhile, Lia and several members of the group headed to The Bear for a reunion. Lia, along with a man who revealed his name to be Torren, discussed the havoc the doppelganger had wroughtâ€”ruining The Claspâ€™s treasury in Kymal and sullying their reputation with hired mercenaries. They debated strategies to conceal the incident. Ruby reminded Lia of their deal, and eventually Lia gave her the ring, promising Torren that she would find a new one for him. The ring, capable of casting *Disguise Self* once per day for one hour, bore the symbol of The Clasp. Lia also tried to persuade Idris and Ruby to join The Clasp, arguing that their aid would help protect the people of Kymal from Krishtanâ€™s harmful actions. Although they declined, they received a letter of recommendationâ€”and a word of caution that The Clasp operated quite independently in every city, so its influence might be limited.

---

### **On the Road**

The group eventually gathered at the South Gate, where a caravan awaited departure. Viola located them, and after brief introductions, they left the city together.

After about four hours on the road, they set up camp and got acquainted with the caravanâ€™s members. The caravan was transporting discarded mining equipment to Westruunâ€”since Kymal no longer needed it.

#### **1. Garron Holt â€“ Caravan Leader**  
**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A broad-shouldered man in his late 40s with graying dark hair and a close-cut beard. He wears a weathered leather coat over chainmail and carries a longsword at his side. His confident stance and sharp eyes command respect.

---

### **2. Dalia Voss â€“ Scout and Tracker**  
**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A lean woman in her early 30s with a scar across her cheek and sun-leathered skin. She keeps her dark hair in a tight braid and wears a mottled green cloak over studded leather.

---

### **3. Bram Gull â€“ Veteran Guard**  
**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A burly man in his 50s with a shaved head and a thick gray beard. He wears half-plate armor and wields a heavy crossbow.

---

### **4. Tilda Fen â€“ Cook and Healer**  
**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A stout woman in her late 40s with freckled skin and hair tucked under a headscarf. She carries a wooden staff and wears a holy symbol of **Everlight** around her neck.

---

### **5. Tobin Darrick â€“ Cart Driver and Tinkerer**  
**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A wiry young man in his mid-20s with messy brown hair and quick, darting eyes. His hands are constantly fidgeting with tools.

---

With the city receding behind them and the open road ahead, they journeyed onward. To their left, the shadow of Ironseat Ridge loomed; to their right, the dividing plains with its slowly rolling hills stretched as far as the eye could see. Their destination was the Silvercut Crossroads.

## **Session 19: On The Road**

### **Getting to Know the Caravan Members**

The group continued their travels, taking time to learn more about their new companions.

#### **1. Garron Holt â€“ Caravan Leader**  
**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A broad-shouldered man in his late 40s with graying dark hair and a close-cut beard. He wears a weathered leather coat over chainmail and carries a longsword at his side. His confident stance and sharp eyes command respect.

**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A lean woman in her early 30s with a scar across her cheek and sun-weathered skin. She keeps her dark hair in a tight braid and wears a mottled green cloak over studded leather.

**Race:** Human  
**Appearance:** A wiry young man in his mid-20s with messy brown hair and quick, darting eyes. His hands are constantly fidgeting with tools.

---

### **An Early Morning Surprise**

When they woke, a pungent smell greeted them. Tilda had cooked a hearty breakfast porridge, throwing in generous handfuls of herbs. Though edible, it brought tears to many eyes. Tilda, ever cheerful, urged everyone to eat up. Abokar, on the other hand, loved it and ate with gusto.

### **A Talk with Bram**

Around noon, Bram sat alone, staring out across the open fields, away from the rest of the group. He clutched a crumpled letter in one hand, occasionally balling the other into a fist. Abokar approached, asking if Bram was all right. At first, Bram hesitated, but Abokar had a gentle way with words, reminding him that sharing a burden sometimes lessens it.

Bram admitted he always felt off after visiting Kymal. Finally, he passed Abokar the letter.

#### **Letter from Joyce to Bram**  
*(Written on crumpled parchment, water-stained and smudged.)*

**Bram,**  

Did you think Iâ€™d never find out? That Iâ€™d never hear your name again?  

I followed your advice. **No begging. Stand strong.** And what did that get me?  

Nothing.  

The mines dried up. My work disappeared. And where were you? You never came back. You never looked. I lost everything, Bram.  

Youâ€™d probably say I shouldâ€™ve â€œfought harder.â€ I tried. But this city doesnâ€™t care. The only reason I still eat is a kind woman who leaves food in hidden placesâ€”**part of some secret group that actually helps people like me.** Thatâ€™s more than you ever did.  

I hope you live long enough to regret it.  

**â€“ Joyce**  

Bram confided that his daughter was somewhere in Kymal; he hasnâ€™t seen her in ages and isnâ€™t sure how to return to her life. Heâ€™s certain sheâ€™s tough enough to get by, but he doesnâ€™t know exactly where she is. Abokar offered to help find her the next time they pass through Kymal. Bram thanked him but remained uneasy. Moments later, he stood and said it was time to move on.

### **An Encounter with a Mysterious Stranger**

Later that afternoon, Dalia, the scout, alerted everyone to the approach of a stranger. Garron warned the group to stay alert and let him handle any inquiries about their cargo.

They soon found a hooded, monk-like old man standing in the middle of the road with a small pushcart. He greeted them with theatrical excitement, proclaiming that they had arrived precisely where he foretold they would be. Opening a side cabinet on his cart, he pulled out a doily and placed a crystal ball on top with a flourish.

â€œCome, donâ€™t be shy! For a mere five gold pieces, I can reveal your future!â€ he exclaimed, beckoning to the caravan.

Viola was tempted to skirt around him, but Garron pointed out the risk of getting stuck in the roadside mud. While they debated, Idris stepped forward, handed the man five gold, and mentioned his own connections to the spirit world. The old man nodded vigorously, lit some incense, and began his cryptic mutterings.

Viola, however, slipped out of sight, turned invisible, and crept around to the pushcart. She watched the stranger flick a hidden switch that filled the crystal ball with white mist, causing Idris to focus intently on the old manâ€™s pronouncements about danger in the color green and the perils of water.

Unseen, Viola flicked the switch off, dispersing the mist. The old man sputtered, insisting the spirits were merely being shy. Idris grew suspicious, as the charlatan fumbled with his contraption. Eventually, Viola triggered the smoke device one last time after the old man had packed up his crystal ball, prompting Idris to demand a refund. Unknown to the so-called fortune-teller, Viola had already stolen back the gold. Panicked, the man crawled around looking for his coins.

Nickolas lost patience and advanced, unconcerned with the cart blocking the road. Abokar leapt in, hefting the pushcart in a single motion and hurling it into the nearby trees, where it splintered with a crash. The group moved on while the flustered man trudged back toward Kymal. Idris lingered briefly, hoping to retrieve the crystal orb, but found only broken pieces. With a quick sending to Huxley, he warned of the charlatanâ€™s description before rejoining the caravan.

### **The Second Night**

That evening, they made camp. During Abokarâ€™s watch, he tried showing Tobin how to properly patrol, though the young man only half-listened. Nickolas, on his own shift, noticed a faint glow beneath the pickaxes and mining equipment in one of the wagons. Curious, he asked Dalia about it when she returned from scouting. She brushed it off as harmless, insisting it was part of the shipment. Still, she lingered near the wagon after that.

At dawn, Tilda once again served up an intensely pungent porridge. She gave Abokar two extra portions, which he devoured happily.

### **Daliaâ€™s Worries**

As the caravan continued the next day, Viola noticed Dalia acting more anxious than before. Rather than scouting far ahead, she stayed close, repeatedly glancing at Nickolas and whispering with Garron. Viola suggested they scout together. Once out of earshot, Viola confronted her about the unusual behavior.

Dalia confided that Garron trusts her, and he can sense trouble brewing. She admitted she wasnâ€™t sure they could trust Nickolasâ€”he seemed too aware of what they were hauling. She hinted that this supposedly â€œdried upâ€ mineral source might still be producing, and if the Margrave of Kymal found out, he would only exploit it.

Viola advised her to act normal and stop raising suspicions, warning that Nickolas was sharp enough to keep digging if she seemed too nervous. Dalia nodded, though she still appeared unsettled.

### **A Nice Stew**

At midday, Ruby helped Tilda prepare a stew, curious about the potent herbs. Tilda began with standard ingredientsâ€”dried meat, potatoes, and carrotsâ€”then tossed in her usual fistful of herbs. Ruby pleaded for moderation, but Tilda laughed as if sheâ€™d heard a good joke. In a moment of inspiration, Ruby fished out a large melon from her Bag of Colding. Tilda looked puzzled at the strange â€œgiant berry,â€ but shrugged and tossed it in anyway, followed by another hearty handful of herbs. Everyone except Viola, who was out scouting, tucked in. Abokar relished every bite, keeping up his energy as they drew closer to their destination.

### **An Ambush**

That afternoon, Violaâ€”scouting aheadâ€”heard a muffled cry from the caravanâ€™s direction. She hurried back and spotted four small goblins hurriedly covering something with dirt and leaves near the road. â€œGood enough!â€ one of them whispered as they turned to leave. Without hesitation, Viola closed in, shifted into bear form, and attacked.

But it was a trap: an orc and three more goblins emerged. Even stranger, three of the â€œgoblinsâ€ began flickering, one moment looking like goblins, the next like crudely painted planks. Viola roared, alerting the caravan. Abokar, Idris, and Bram sprinted forward, while the rest stayed back to guard the wagons.

One goblinâ€™s arm wavered oddly, transforming into multiple arms that stabbed several times in a single thrust. Viola, in bear form, took the brunt of the assault. Reinforcements soon joined her, and they realized that fire was pretty effective. One by one, the enemies fell, leaving Viola exhausted from reverting to her normal form and then shifting back to a second bear shape in the heat of battle.

After the dust settled, Viola approached the spot where the goblins had been covering something. Brushing aside dirt and leaves, she froze. Lying there, lifeless, was Daria.

## **Session 20: Dead Not-Dead Dead**

### **Aftermath of the Ambush**

As the dust settled from the ravager ambush, Viola cautiously approached Dalia, who lay lifeless, half-buried in dirt and leaves by the roadside. Leaning in to administer CPR, Viola jumped as Dalia's eyes suddenly shot open, a scream erupting from her throat as she convulsed in shock.

The caravan quickly rushed in, trying to soothe her panic. Between desperate gasps, Dalia began recounting how a goblin had stabbed her repeatedly at unnatural speed. Yet mid-explanation, she abruptly fell silent, collapsing again, utterly lifeless. Confusion rippled through the group as they moved supplies aside in the cart to rest her body. Meanwhile, Viola noticed her own wounds mysteriously healing and reopeningâ€”a disturbing echo of Abokar's previous afflictions and those of her former comrades.

### **Abokar's Introspection**

Abokar retreated inward, sifting through his memories of splintered wood and shattered shields, questioning whether these past battles were truly against goblins painted into existence. His reflections made him vulnerable, allowing the dark entity that held sway over him to slip into his thoughts. It whispered secretsâ€”an alchemical ritual capable of restoring Dalia, freeing her from the torture of repeated death.

Abokar, shaken but resolute, pulled himself back to reality, the whispers lingering but unspoken to his companions.

### **Viola's Experiments**

Viola, troubled by her fluctuating wounds, theorized that each injury corresponded with the painted goblins' shifting states of existence. Despite Abokar's skepticism, he gathered the painted and real weapons scattered around the ambush site. Viola sorted them methodically, linking certain weapons to her injuries and others to Dalia's endless cycle of death and revival.

Holding onto the weapon that mirrored her wounds, Viola handed the one associated with Dalia to Tilda, who diligently watched over Daliaâ€™s remains.

Abokar, meanwhile, performed his own experiment, burning a wooden painted weapon. Initially unremarkable, the ashes suddenly transformed into a wet sludge emitting an iron scent, shimmering subtly with metallic particles. Carefully, he collected samples for further analysis.

### **Distracted at Night**

On watch beneath a clear, star-filled sky, Ruby found herself captivated by a single, slow-moving star. Entranced, she felt comfort and certaintyâ€”a sense of being on the right path despite recent horrors. Lost in its glow, Ruby had no sense of passing time until Ronald shook her awake. Hours had vanished unnoticed. The night sky had shifted normally, except for that singular, unmoving light. Ronald, however, saw only ordinary stars.

### **A Recently Ambushed Caravan**

With the Silvercut crossroads mere hours away, the party came upon the wreckage of recently attacked carts ahead. Ruby and Ronald crept forward quietly, while Abokar and Nickolas acted openly as distractions. Viola quickly uncovered goblinoid tracks crisscrossing the road and weaving through the brush.

At the scene, they found fresh blood, both red and green, and signs indicating a shipment of pigment and painting supplies. Strangely, valuables and food remained untouchedâ€”the bandits had solely targeted art materials. The group concluded this had to be the same ravagers responsible for the painted goblins.

They decided to follow Violaâ€™s discovered tracks, bidding farewell to Garron Holt's caravan, which hurried onward to Westruun, hoping temple healers could resolve Dalia's unnatural state. Viola warned Garron explicitly not to bury or burn Dalia, convinced the painted weaponry was the culprit. Garron thanked them gratefully before they parted ways.

### **Following the Tracks**

Tracking their quarry deeper into the Ironseat Ridge mountains, the party entered a narrow canyon, where the air chilled noticeably and echoes distorted their sounds. Sparse vegetation clung desperately between stone crevices, and towering peaks induced a sense of vertigo. At times, the sky vanished entirely as they moved briefly through cave passages.

The trail remained clearâ€”scuffed earth and fragments of cloth hinted at bodies being dragged, explaining the absence of corpses at the caravan wreckage. Eventually, the passage opened into an expansive, hidden valley ringed by distant mountains.

### **Disturbed Dirt**

The tracks ended abruptly at patches of disturbed earth. Investigating cautiously, the group quickly uncovered multiple graves containing both skeletal and fresh corpses. Viola grimly determined they had all died from suffocation after being buried alive.

Ruby sent Sir Cheeky ahead for reconnaissance. The flying squirrel darted easily through the trees until reaching a wide clearing. Below, goblins patrolled, carrying more painted goblins, around a fortified hilltop encampment with crude wooden barricades and a large central hut.

They had found the ravagers' main camp.

## **Session 21: Splat the Fortress of Planks!**

### **Squirrel Recon & Goblin Plankception**

While the rest of the group continued searching for survivors in the mass grave outside the city, Ruby sent Sir Cheekyâ€”her flying squirrel companionâ€”on a scouting mission over the hill fort.

Sir Cheeky got dangerously close to several goblin patrols. Many of these goblins seemed to carry planks... that sometimes turned *into* goblins. Meanwhile, the original goblin turned *into* a plank. Ruby spotted more of these weird patrols, and from the treetops, she saw several inside the fortress. A massive, dead-looking tree towered over everything, its branches stretching higher than the keep itself.

Within the walls were several watchtowersâ€”and, at the center of it all, a hulking, mutated goblin. Sometimes it had six arms. Sometimes it looked like it was standing, sitting, and lying down all at once. Its actions overlapped, like it was glitching through reality while painting feverishly.

Ruby relayed everything to the group, and a plan began to form.

---

### **Operation: Donâ€™t Split the Party (Too Much)**

Abokar and Ruby would approach the clearing and attempt to quietly eliminate a goblin patrol. Meanwhile, Idris and Rono would sneak around toward the giant dead tree to infiltrate the fortress.

Nickolas and Viola remained hidden in the woods, watching from a distance.

With deft movementsâ€”and an invisibility spellâ€”Idris and Rono scaled the giant tree, gaining a clear view of the goblins inside and the monstrous goblin artist. But before they could act, the sound of combat rang out below.

---

### **Ambush & Go**

Abokar and Ruby successfully isolated a patrol of the strange goblins. They sprang into action and swiftly took them down in a matter of seconds. Ruby, emboldened by the quick win, rushed forward, charging across the open field toward the fortress.

Her bold move triggered chaos. Goblins began pouring out of the fortress and manned their defenses, ready to meet the sudden threat.

---

### **Double Trouble: The Great Skirmish**

Rono and Idris leapt into the fortress, using the distraction outside to breach the wall. Goblins inside scrambled to respond, splitting the enemy's attention.

Back outside, Nickolas emerged, casting his magic to sow confusion among the enemy. Abokar barreled forward, drawing attention like a tank in a thunderstorm. The party had learned that even a single stab from these goblins could manifest as *dozens*â€”but Abokarâ€™s heavy armor made him a frustrating target to crack.

Viola shifted into a massive wolf and tore into the goblins (and maybe a few planks disguised as goblins). Teeth met splinters. Blood met bark. Glorious carnage.

---

### **Glitch Boss Incoming**

A maddening roar echoed as the fortress gates burst open. A giant, grotesque goblin charged into the frayâ€”crystal shard embedded in its twisted face, three versions of it overlapping like flickering illusions. One attack often became three.

Meanwhile, inside the fortress, disaster struck. Idris was caught and nearly downed by a stab-happy goblin. He and Rono scaled the wall again and fled the fortress.

---

### **Idris is Fine. No Wait. He's Dying. Nopeâ€”He's Fine Again.**

As Idris rejoined the battle, something bizarre began to happen: one moment he was bleeding out, the next, completely healed. The cycle repeated maddeninglyâ€”wounded, fine, wounded againâ€”his body flipping between realities like a badly edited film.

---

### **One Goblin, Three Deaths (or Vice Versa)**

The party regrouped and focused all firepower on the mutated goblin. It was tough, resistant to both steel and spell, but eventually fell. As it died, the crystal embedded in its skull dislodged and fell to the ground with a resonant *thunk*.

Idris snatched it up, hiding it away. Rono caught a glimpse and, without hesitation, pulled his pistol and shot it point-blank. *BANG.*

Then again. *BANG.* And again. *BANG.*

But it wasnâ€™t just Rono firing. It looked like dozens of Rono copies all shooting at once, surrounding the crystal. The bullets did nothing. Rono froze in place, trapped in a time-looped moment. Idris turned invisible and disappeared into the underbrush to keep the crystal hidden.

---

### **From Blood to Sawdust: Victory(?)**

The battle didnâ€™t end with the big goblinâ€™s fall. The remaining stabby goblins kept fighting, but the group rallied and finished them offâ€”reducing them to a mix of blood, guts, sawdust, and splinters.

Idrisâ€™s wounds kept blinking in and out of existence, adding a surreal note to the bloody aftermath. As silence returned to the battlefield, the group realized something:

Though the fight was over, a heavy presence still lingered. A pressure they hadnâ€™t noticed during combat now weighed on them. The air felt anxious, like something was holding its breath.

Was something still here?

## **Session 22: Quantum Visions!**

As the smoke from the burning goblin remains and painted planks filled the air, the party gathered around, wary and confused. Ruby's attempt to detect magic initially revealed nothing but lingering traces, until suddenly a powerful unknown magic resonated from the shard Idris had recovered.

Deciding to cast Identify, Ruby triggered an unexpected explosion of magical energy, rippling outwards and enveloping everyone. In an instant, the party was thrust into a shared tapestry of visions, vividly experiencing each other's memories and emotionsâ€”though only the visionâ€™s focal character could control their actions.

### Rubyâ€™s Visions

Ruby stood atop the high walls of Rosohna, her mothers Leylas and Quana at peace by her side. Essek approached warmly, arms wide for an embrace. Ruby attempted composure but flinched, betraying her unease.

Next, she found herself in dark ceremonial robes, standing alongside Essek before a vast army marching under twisted banners. When her deception failed, Essek called guards who attacked with gravity-warping dunamancy, forcing Ruby into desperate evasive maneuvers.

### Idrisâ€™s Visions

Idris found himself on a shadowy road deep within the Shadowfell, ghostly figures beckoning him into darkness. Panicked, he summoned spirits for aid, but they pursued him instead, forcing him to flee. Struggling with dual conflicting memoriesâ€”one where he touched purple mist and teleported, another where a small creature leaped into the mistâ€”he felt his head splitting from confusion.

In contrast, another vision returned Idris to his Xhorhasian clanâ€™s comforting campfire, surrounded by smiling elders and playful children. Overwhelmed by confusion, he slapped himself awake, alarming his father and amusing his brother. As children laughed about "Uncle Idris," he grappled with a disorienting sense of multiple realities.

### Violaâ€™s Visions

Viola first appeared bound tightly to a tree, dagger pressed against her own chest by her own hand. She closed her eyes, to ignore everything but she felt Arnoud Aborius stood before her. Refusing to engage, Viola drove the blade she felt into herself, hearing Arnoud's heartfelt gratitude for her compliance in his grim duty.

Her second vision placed her in an ornate, crystal-lit training hall surrounded by admiring brothers. Hands ablaze with powerful magic, Viola defiantly ignored the illusion, closing her eyes as her brothers, confused by her passivity, accidentally hurled lethal fireballs, bringing her vision to a tragic end.

### Abokarâ€™s Visions

Abokar found himself chained to a dark altar, blood boiling in his veins as masked cultists chanted ominously. Summoning all his strength, he broke free, wielding chains as weapons against his captors, who screamed about "the infernal" escaping.

His next vision was peaceful yet grim; lying wounded on a battlefield, vultures circling above. The voice of the Allhammer warmly welcomed his soul. Accepting this fate, Abokar felt the quiet peace of release, offering no resistance. Idris, trapped within Abokarâ€™s body, desperately attempted spells to fight back but found himself powerless, ultimately succumbing alongside Abokar, who was greeted by a massive dwarf seated proudly upon his throne.

### Nickolasâ€™s Visions

Nickolas stood confidently in a courtroom in Emon, declared innocent by the judge. His father sat proudly, reserved but clearly pleased. Walking away together, he absorbed the rare moment of paternal pride.

In a stark contrast, Nickolas later walked through Kymal, feared and respected. Behind him, the Muddy Boot Inn lay shattered. Citizens fled before him, shouting warnings about "the Arbiter." Though powerful and feared, Nickolas silently began restoring order, cleaning the chaos left behind.

### Aftermath & Revelations

As the visions faded, the party realized they'd intimately shared each other's deepest experiences. Ruby soon identified the recovered artifact as the Quantum Shard, a fragment of something largerâ€”the Celestia Prism.

Attuning to the shard, Ruby immediately felt its demanding strain. Using its power, she successfully cast Quantum Collapse, undoing reality itself to erase the goblin-plank weapons' existence. Each use of the shard brought a disturbing sensation, a brief halt in reality, revealing the dangerous fragility of manipulating parallel worlds.

Meanwhile, Idris explored the mutated goblin leaderâ€™s hut, where space twisted erratically, cycling through multiple versions of the interior in a chaotic, glitchy dance. The walls had painted pictures, balloons, dolls, and strange lines but none of it made any sense to the group. Attempts to retrieve or interact with items proved futile or hazardous, ultimately leading Abokar to set fire to all realities of the hut in exasperation.

### Questions & Concerns

Gathering their thoughts, the party pondered deeply on the nature of these strange events. Why had Abokar stopped receiving wounds years ago, only to become vulnerable again recently? What did the goblinâ€™s appearance during the massive battle three years ago imply?

Exhausted from the mental strain and Rubyâ€™s overuse of the shard, the group returned to the safety of the mountain road, establishing a camp to rest and recover. However, peace was short-lived; during his watch, Abokar noticed the unsettling gleam of eyes watching them from the shadows.

A sense of unease lingeredâ€”perhaps the worst was yet to come.

## **Session 23: Ghostly Problems**

### Awakened with a Cry

Abokar stared into the darkness, spotting eyes glinting in the nightâ€”larger than a cat's. Taking no chances, he slashed his hand, igniting his weapon in flame. The flash triggered an immediate reaction. From the shadows, a figure screamed and charged at him.

The scream jolted the camp awake. A humanoid shape, twisted in rage, rushed forward. The voice was both masculine and monstrousâ€”something was deeply wrong.

Nickolas quickly lit his lantern, revealing a man clad in chainmail, eyes stark white, mouth foaming, moving with strange, jerky motions. Each step left behind a faint echo or vapor trail.

Abokar struck with his flaming weapon, but the fire seemed to empower the man, whose own weapon burst into flames. Ruby sprinted forward to assist Abokar.

Idris disappeared into a tree, and Viola melted into the shadows.

### The Man Dies, the Creature Remains

In a brief but brutal clash, Abokar decapitated the raving attacker. The body crumpledâ€”but in its place, a ghostly wail erupted. A translucent specter lingered, howling.

The scream struck Ruby with such terror that she felt her life force drainâ€”she aged 60 years in moments.

The spirit then lunged into Abokar, possessing him. His eyes turned white as he moved erratically and lunged at Nickolas with jarring, unnatural swings.

Viola emerged and touched Abokar, attempting to purge the evil. Nickolas invoked Turn Undead, but it failed to drive the entity out. Idris, recalling lore of powerful ghosts, realized they would either need powerful magic or to knock the possessed body unconscious.

Shouting arcane insults, Idris injured Abokar. Viola, now a wild boar, charged to knock him down. Ruby, shaking off her terror despite her aged body, joined the fray with shadowy blades, using them like a cane for support.

Eventually, Nickolas cast *Command*, and Ruby struck with *Booming Blade*. However Abokar was knocked out before that. The ghost was expelled and raged violently, striking with necrotic fury. As Abokar was healed, he obeyed the command and moved, he triggered opportunity attacks and the delayed booming magic. 

Together, the party eventually brought the entity down, exhausted but victorious.

### The Interrogation

Idris cast *Speak with Dead* on the attackerâ€™s severed head. Meanwhile, Abokar discovered a tattooâ€”a drop of blood with a daggerâ€”the mark of the Claret Order, the same group from his visions. He also found a cryptic note referencing shadows as the key, along with a crude sketch of the Silvercut Crossroads monument.

Idris asked:

**Where did you come from?**
"I came from the crypts under the Silvercut Crossroads."

**Why were you there?**
"I was looking for the treasures of the Claret Order."

**Who else was there?**
"I was alone there, no one else but me to claim everything."

**Why did you do that?**
"I want the wealth and power their artifacts will surely give me."

**Were you part of the Claret Order?**
"I was a junior member. They didn't let me into the Silvercut Crossroads cache. I ran away to find their treasures."

### Trying to Fix Ruby

While Nickolas tracked the manâ€™s trail, Viola attempted to dispel the magic aging Ruby. The spell seemed to failâ€”Ruby fled into a tent in tears, cycling through grief. Moments later, she emerged youthful again. Viola surmised the spell worked, but with a delay.

The group rested, examining the cryptic note.

### Travel to the Crossroads

On the road, Rubyâ€™s illusion magic wore off again. Viola cast *Dispel Magic*, but again it seemed ineffective.

The party debated whether to stop at the Crossroads or catch up with the caravanâ€”particularly to help Dalia Vos, last seen caught in a horrific quantum state of life and death. Viola volunteered to transform into a horse to carry Ruby ahead, but Nickolas warned against splitting the group. He argued they should move as a unit, skipping the crypts if needed, and catch up with the caravan together.

### The Silvercut Crossroads

They arrived at the crossroads monumentâ€”an obelisk surrounded by four warrior statues, each flanked by unlit braziers. Nickolas was ready to move on, but Abokar paused to examine the area and spotted a Claret Order symbol scratched onto a nearby rock.

Ruby used her Quantum Shard to detect nearby magic. No quantum magic was found, but she did sense protection magic emanating from the moss on the obelisk.

Idris eagerly lit all four braziers. Abokar noticed the moss on the obelisk reacted to the shadows of the statues. He instructed the group to strike poses matching the statues, allowing their shadows to fall onto the obelisk.

Reluctantly, Nickolas complied. After 30 seconds, the moss glowed brightly, then vanished, revealing a hidden staircase into the obelisk.

### The Crypt Entrance

Ruby sent Sir Cheeky, her flying squirrel, to scout. Inside was a small crypt chamber, stone slabs, and a single imposing door with a massive skull set with two diamond eyesâ€”one dull and gray, the other brilliant and clear.

The party descended and examined the door. Above it was an inscription in Celestial, which Idris translated:

> "Its gaze will burn, its beauty liesâ€”
> Touch not the gleam that guards the eyes.
> What once turned to dust may turn once moreâ€”
> Twist the past to open the door."

Despite Violaâ€™s caution, Idris touched the door and the dull & grey gem, with no result. Nickolas held up a torch, trying something with the fire to no effect. Eventually, Abokar realized the skull could be rotated. With a loud *click*, the door opened.

### Small or Large?

The next series of rooms featured two doors eachâ€”one small, one largeâ€”and riddles on the walls. Ruby had cast *Comprehend Languages* and joined Idris in deciphering the clues.

> "I break the ground with thunderâ€™s pace, but shatter when I lose the race."

The group knocked and opened the small door.

> "Tall I stand with towering pride, yet shadows slip right past my side."

They cleverly observed that the small door retained shadows unnaturally longer. They decided the larger door is normal so they choose it as their passage.

### The Gargoyle

Finally, they entered a large crypt chamber. Ahead, a massive gargoyle statue blocked a corridor. Though unmoving, its gaze seemed to track themâ€”a silent sentinel, ancient and ominous.

## **Session 24: Silvercut Crossroads**

### The Gargoyle

The group entered a large crypt chamber. Ahead, a massive gargoyle statue blocked the corridor. Though unmoving, its gaze seemed to follow themâ€”a silent sentinel, ancient and ominous.

On the ground were three bowls: one gold, one iron, and one wooden. On the walls, carved as part of the original architecture, was the inscription:

> â€œMade by kings, forged for war, or shaped by humble handâ€”  
> I care not for wealth, nor wrath, but what the living give unplanned.  
> The gift must come from deep within,  
> Poured with pain, and not with sin.â€

The gargoyleâ€™s clawed hands were held out in front of it, as if to receive one of the bowls. Above it, holes in the ceiling matched the shape and size of its hands.

Idris peered through a gap between the gargoyleâ€™s wings and saw a 15-foot-wide pit in the corridor beyond.

Piecing together the clues, Ruby took the wooden bowl, placed it in the gargoyle's hands, then slashed her palm and dripped blood into it. The gargoyle lifted its head, examined the group, then retracted into the ceilingâ€”its hands jamming into the overhead holesâ€”leaving the passage clear.

### The Corridor

The group found the corridor blocked by a pit lined with spikes. Viola, however, walked calmly along the wall and ceiling, carrying a long rope. One end was held by Abokar, while she tied the other to a barred door at the corridorâ€™s end.

Nickolas tested a wall sconce to see if it could hold the rope. It came loose on a hinge with a click. Curious, he pulled it againâ€”more clicks, but no clear effect. Idris reached a second sconce further along, but it was stuck. When he stepped onto the floor on the far side of the pit, it collapsed, revealing a deeper trap beneath.

Nickolas pulled the sconce againâ€”this time, locking the trap in place. Using the rope, he crossed safely, and Abokar leapt across, though the floor creaked ominously under his weight.

### Finding a Hole

At the end of the corridor, they entered a small crypt chamber with chairs and a tableâ€”furniture clearly added later. A ruined tomb dedicated to the Platinum Dragon, god of lawful good, life, and war, stood desecrated. Large, purple concentric circles were scrawled wildly across the room.

Upon closer inspection, they found handwritten text in an unknown language. Ruby deciphered it partiallyâ€”curses against the Platinum Dragon, along with phrases like: *The Eye opened. The Eye showed us the way.* Also: *CLOSEâ€”but we must dig deeper. The Eye says to dig deeper!*

Meanwhile, Viola began hearing a distant, repetitive electrical sound: *KKzzzz... KKKzkzzz...*

Nickolas discovered several discarded notesâ€”doodles from boredom, and a sheet tallying roughly 30 days, dated three years ago. Oddly, there was a single newer entry from less than a month ago: *Cael was here!*

In the tomb, they found a hole. Ruby sent her squirrel to investigate. It led to a tunnel with branching dead-ends, though one seemed to lead outside, hidden by planks and vegetation. The tunnel had clearly been dug from within the tomb, widened crudely with makeshift tools.

### If You Are Pure and Good, Then Walk

Returning to the corridor, they opened a second doorâ€”revealing a room-spanning pit that appeared bottomless. At the far end, golden script read: *â€œIf you are pure and good, then walk.â€*

The phrase reminded Nickolas of the stolen *Amulet of Pure Good*, which allows one to mask their alignment. He debated with Viola, arguing that true goodness doesnâ€™t exist.

Viola attempted to climb the walls but couldnâ€™t stick to them. Neither could Idris gain a grip. Nickolas, despite Viola's encouragement, found no invisible bridge.

Tied with a safety rope, Ruby stepped forward andâ€”after a brief fallâ€”landed on an invisible bridge, allowing her to cross.

She explored one room filled with chains and pedestals. Mistaking it for a torture chamber, she noticed a flag bearing the Claret Orderâ€™s symbol and closed the door without entering further. She crossed to a set of double doors, opening them to a massive chamber beyond.

From across the pit, Abokar glimpsed the room and was struck by a powerful sense of dÃ©jÃ  vuâ€”something just out of reach.

### The Great Tomb Chamber

Ruby described what she saw: a grand chamber once dedicated to the Platinum Dragon, now ransacked. Paint covered the walls; strange purple markings defiled every surface. Text cursed the Platinum Dragon and praised "the Eye," celebrating some unnamed success.

Chains lay broken across the floor, pillars were toppled, and items once placed on pedestals were missing. Ruby identified a massive destroyed and disrupted *Dispel Magic* ritual focused on the central tomb that was, from which the repeating *KKkzzzzzp... KKKZZZzzzp* noise emanated.

Meanwhile, Abokar and the others entered through one of the dug tunnels, breaking through into the same chamber.

### Dangerous Items

Scattered plaques described the dangerous items once stored here:

- **Scroll A-17: Withering Pact**  
  *Do not read aloud. Causes irreversible soul decay.*

- **Chain E-11: Zealotâ€™s Embrace**  
  *Induces obedience to demonic will. Do not wear.*

- **Artifact B-04: Idol of Vurozz**  
  *Silences all sound within 10 ft. Prolonged exposure leads to madness.*

- **[Broken Plaque]**  
  *Ge** *: Whi*** **re  
  Contains bound soul fragments. Emits auditory hallucinations.*

The items were missing, but Idris was enragedâ€”"the soul is a sacred thing."

### The Quantum Tomb

Inside the central tomb, they found another crudely dug hole. Within were old weapons and planks painted to look like weaponsâ€”*KKZZHHH*â€”they flickered between realities. When some became real, Abokar felt an old wound reopen.

At the center was a stone pedestal with two metal prongsâ€”clearly meant to hold an item. Using *Detect Magic* via the Quantum Shard, Ruby saw the tomb glowed with quantum magicâ€”especially the prongs.

She gathered the old weapons. During the process, she stepped on a stone slate with Common writing.

After puzzling it together, they read:

**Object ID:** X-01-Î©  
**Designation:** The Shard of Unknown Magic  

| Date                 | Examiner                 | Summary                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 988 PD, 5 Duscar     | Scribe Leren Voss        | Field stable. Minor reality bleed detected. Containment holding.        |
| 989 PD, 17 Sydenstar | Arcanist Elra Dynn       | Noted increased resonance. Recalibrated null field.                     |
| 999 PD, 9 Fessuran   | Inquisitor Jhalen Thorne | Rumors of similar effect near Stilben. Scheduled for reassessment.      |

The last entry was from just over a month ago.

Ruby then used the Quantum Shard to collapse reality into a version where the painted weapons never existed. Sweat poured from her face under the strain.

### The Lab Antechamber

All but Viola crossed into the small room bearing the Claret Order flag. It was pristineâ€”untouched by looters. Two pedestals held chained-down objects:

- **Object ID:** L-07-V  
  **Designation:** Lantern of Lost Names  
  *Glows in presence of forgotten memories. Sometimes utters names in Deep Speech.*

- **Object ID:** C-21-R  
  **Designation:** Coin of Twinned Paths  
  *When flipped at a crossroads, reveals both choicesâ€™ first consequences.*

Idris took both. Upon touching the lantern, a guttural word in Deep Speech echoed around them, and the lantern began to glow.

Behind the flag was nothing but a wall.

### The Lab

Abokar entered the main labâ€”a converted temple of the Platinum Dragon. Mosaics depicted the Calamity, showing the Platinum Dragonâ€™s armies triumphing over the Betrayer Gods. But the altar had been converted into a metal-clad bed with chains and tubes.

Abokar froze. He recognized the place from nightmaresâ€”rituals he had interrupted while restrained to that very bed. He suddenly knew exactly how to use the device to bring someone back from the dead.

Without hesitation, Abokar furiously deconstructed the altar-bed, flinging parts across the room. Idris, Ruby, and Nickolas entered carefully, keeping their distance.

The lab had been turned into a research site. Bookshelves stood empty, but tucked behind them were notes:

**Excerpt â€“ Observation Deck, Day 4**  
*"When held near other cursed objects, the shard induces resonance. Reality thins. The term â€˜quantum curseâ€™ was coined here, but feels insufficient. Itâ€™s more like the rules are debating themselves."*

Another document detailed a subject:

**Name:** Belthra Cael  
**Date of Birth:** Unknown

### Fierna

Abokar calmed slightly, though not before grabbing the lantern from Idris his hands and throwing that against a wall, breaking the glass of the lantern. Idris let it go and decided to examined the broken chains from the bedâ€”etched with repeating infernal runes. He spoke the word aloud: *Fierna*.

Abokarâ€™s blood boiled. Flames erupted briefly from within him as he screamed and lunged at Idris in rage. Idris narrowly dodged.

"NEVER say that word again!" echoed across the crypt.

## **Session 25: Demon Summoning And Coin Flipping**

### Putting Pieces Together

The group regrouped with Viola, who had remained behind in the previous crypt chamber. As tensions eased, they began discussing what they had discovered, piecing together a rough timeline of events. They speculated that Belthra Cael may have been resurrected under a contractâ€”perhaps something akin to Abokar's own fate.

They theorized that the Claret Order returned to the crypt annually to check on the shard and maintain the containment rituals. The last visit appeared to have been just a month ago. They debated whether goblins had dug into the crypt and stolen the shardâ€”or whether a cult of "The Eye" took the shard, with the goblins looting the remains.

Whatever the case, several dangerous items had clearly been removedâ€”possibly including another shard, or the one they now held. Another clue hinted that the Claret Order had traveled to Stilben, investigating rumors of similar quantum effects occurring there.

### Through the Goblin Tunnels

To Rubyâ€™s dismay, the group used the goblin-dug tunnels to exit the crypt. Crawling through the tight, dirty passages, they eventually reached a crude hatch at the end. Light poured in from outside, along with the sound of birds and wind in the trees.

But the fresh air was tainted by a strange stench of decay. Listening carefully, they heard a guttural, rhythmic chanting nearby.

The group split upâ€”those skilled in stealth moved ahead to scout the source of the sound.

### The Demon Summoning

They found a twitching goblin, surrounded by black smoke and ritual markings drawn in goblin blood. Many goblin corpses lay nearby, slowly burning and being consumed by the dark smoke.

Around the black smoke stood four ritual circles, each with a blue flame. The goblin moved erratically, clearly not in control of itself, its fearful eyes wide as it chanted frantically. Then, from two of the flames, creatures the group recognizedâ€”**Dretches**â€”crawled forth.

### Decisive Action

Viola rushed back to inform Nickolas and Abokar. Without hesitation, Abokar grabbed his axe and charged. Ruby moved to disrupt the ritual, sneaking up to one of the blue flames and disturbing the circle around it. The flame vanished. The Dretches howled in anger, and the goblin paused before resuming its frenzied chanting.

As Ruby neared the rift, she caught a glimpse of the **Abyss** beyondâ€”twisting horrors and hungering eyes that chilled her to the core.

### Stop the Ritual!

Idris loosed arrows. Abokarâ€™s axe burned with green flame as he struck. More Dretches emerged from the remaining circles, prompting Ruby to disrupt two more, each time suffering a wave of psychic dread. Viola, unnoticed, disabled the final circle.

Only the goblin remainedâ€”chanting still, despite injury. Around its neck, a large, animate chain constricted and whispered to it, clearly influencing its actions.

From the dark portal, a massive orange-furred hand reached through, clawing at the edges of the rift.

Idris cast **Tashaâ€™s Hideous Laughter**, and the goblin collapsed, laughing uncontrollably.

### Silence!

Yet, the goblin rose again like a puppet on stringsâ€”twitching and chanting. Nickolas rummaged through his pack, produced a scroll, and read it aloud. **Silence** fell over the scene. The goblin continued mouthing words, but no sound came.

The summoning circle stopped growing. The demonic hand clawed at the rift, unable to pass through.

### Axe to the Face

Abokar slipped into the shadows and gazed into the riftâ€”seeing the **Abyss** fully now. A **Barlgura**â€”a monstrous, ape-like demon with orange fur and tusksâ€”was forcing its way toward the portal.

Ruby joined him. Her horror deepened as she saw not one, but **several** of the creatures converging on the rift.

With combined effortâ€”and the might of Abokarâ€™s axeâ€”the goblin was slain. Its body dissolved into shadow, and the rift collapsed, severing the Barlguraâ€™s hand, which fell to the ground, twitching.

### Loot and Resting

Investigating the scene, the group deduced that a recent battle had occurredâ€”goblins fighting among themselves. Around the goblin's neck, they found the cursed item:

- **Chain E-11: Zealotâ€™s Embrace**  
  *Induces obedience to demonic will. Do not wear.*

They carefully wrapped it in cloth and stuffed it into Nickolasâ€™s **Bag of Holding**. A faint whisper of rage echoed from the chain as it disappeared.

Meanwhile, Viola inspected the severed hand. It matched descriptions from an old play by Arnaudâ€”one of the villains was a leaping orange ape. It had been inspired by a **Barlgura**, which Viola had once dismissed as fiction.

Among the corpses, the group found gems worth 10 gold and a healing potion.

They took a short rest.

### Coin of Twinned Paths

Idris experimented with the items recovered from the Claret Order cache. The **Lantern of Lost Names** never stopped glowing dimlyâ€”suggesting forgotten memories. Occasionally, it shouted names in **Deep Speech**.

At the **Silvercut Crossroads**, Idris flipped the **Coin of Twinned Paths**, wondering: what if they returned to **Kymal**, or continued to **Westruun**?

The coin spun mid-air. Idrisâ€™s eyes turned white, his head thrown back. In a trance, he saw two paths:

- First, the group walking back to Kymalâ€”until they surrounded a man hanging upside-down from a tree. The man screeched a nasal **"Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©Ã©"** before the vision ended.

- Then, they saw themselves heading to Westruunâ€”two days passed in seconds, until a vision appeared: an upside-down **wagon**, floating.

The vision ended. Idris collapsedâ€”**blind**. His companions panicked as he stumbled and groped around, though some couldnâ€™t resist cracking a few eye jokes.

### A Long Rest

To save time, **Viola transformed into a horse** to carry Idris as they hurried to catch up with the caravan. The caravan was transporting **Dalia Vos**, a victim of quantum effectsâ€”locked in an endless loop of dying and reviving.

That night, they made camp.

- **Abokarâ€™s watch** passed without issueâ€”a peaceful night beneath a starry sky.  
- **Viola**, having massaged Idris's head earlier (and dreamed of shadowy worlds and sore feet), took second watch. She noticed a **bright star** that moved oddlyâ€”unlike any other. She didnâ€™t recall seeing it before.  
- **Nickolas**, on third watch, tried to track the starâ€™s movement but was thwarted by clouds.  
- **Ruby**, on final watch, immediately found the starâ€”and became **entranced**. The world faded away. She felt safeâ€”at home.

Idris, still blind, stirred but fell back asleep. Abokar awoke, confused by the high sun. He rushed to find Ruby standing motionless, eyes fixed on the sky. Shaking her free, she realized she had lost **hours**.

Abokarâ€™s grumbling woke everyone. â€œIn a hurry to catch a caravan, and weâ€™re standing around star-gazing...â€

Nickolas used **Remove Curse** on Idrisâ€”restoring his sight.

They quickly packed up and began the new day.

## **Session 26: The Caravan is Floating**

### What's Wrong with Ruby

As the group continued their fast-paced journey to make up for lost time, talk turned once again to Ruby.

It was the second night in a row sheâ€™d fallen into a catatonic stateâ€”staring blankly up at a bright, strange star in the direction they were headed. Theories flew. Ruby said it made her feel â€œlike home.â€ But none of the others felt the same. Maybe it was tied to her connection with the quantum shard? But then again, she had already been acting this way before they even possessed the shard.

Could it be something about her homeland? She tried to trace the starâ€™s direction to her continent of origin, but it didnâ€™t line up. If anything, the star seemed to hang northeastâ€”towards Westruun and Whitestone, not the Krynn Dynasty.

Idris spoke with Viola and asked if she might use her mysterious massage ability to "see" what Ruby sees in her dreams. Ruby, surprised to hear Viola might even *have* such a power, noted that only very powerful magic could normally affect dreams like that. She wasnâ€™t opposedâ€”but she wasnâ€™t ready to try it just yet.

### The Next Night

To avoid another episode, Ruby was taken off night watch. Still, that night several people noticed something oddâ€”riders with torches far off in the distance. They moved restlessly across the plains, never approaching, never leaving. The group kept an eye on them, but aside from their unsettling presence, nothing happened.

Later that night, Ruby left the tent briefly to relieve herself. When she returned, a glint of light caught her eyeâ€”and she froze. Once again, the star had her.

Abokar, noticing her, rushed to wake Viola, but she just waved him off, too tired to deal with any of it that night.

Ruby eventually snapped out of it with help from Idris and Abokar and quietly returned to bed.

### The Caravan is Upside Down

By midday, the group had made excellent timeâ€”only to stop dead in their tracks.

Floating a few feet above the road was the caravan they were trying to catch.

Upside-down.

Alongside it, slowly spinning and suspended in the air, was a second wagon. On its side: **TumbleToys â€“ Whiterunâ€™s Finest**. Scattered all around them were glowing white rocks and a surreal assortment of floating toys.

Both caravansâ€™ members were helplessly drifting mid-air, lips cracked and dryâ€”seemingly stuck like this for hours. The only one not caught in the phenomenon was Tobin, who was frantically tinkering with something when the group startled him.

Tobin explained that this had started the day before. Heâ€™d been relieving himself so wasn't stuck in the effect and has been trying to build a catapult of sortsâ€”something that could launch an object *into* the field at high speed. Normal throws lost all momentum once they crossed the boundary. Abokar had already tested thatâ€”rocks and tools simply *floated*.

Tobin had marked the edge of the effect in the dirt, and the boundary hadnâ€™t shifted since.

Seeing the group arrive, Tobin and the stranded caravan members lit up with hope.

Nickolas did ask why Tobin didn't just use a very long stick instead of building such a complex device. *oops*

### From Bad to Worse

Eager to investigate, Ruby pulled out the Quantum Shard and cast an enhanced *Detect Magic* through it.

Bad idea.

The shard began to hum with an ominous resonanceâ€”and the field erupted into chaos.

Objects and people were violently flung back and forth within the floating zone. A toy slammed into the head of the TumbleToys driver, knocking him out cold. A spinning fighter, likely a bodyguard, lost what little control he hadâ€”vomiting midair before passing out.

Ruby, however, did manage to glean a painful insight: this was yet another unknown form of magic. A third â€œflavor,â€ distinct from the Quantum effects or the Hum Dust theyâ€™d seen before.

Realizing the shard was aggravating the effect, she moved far away. The field stabilized *slightly*â€”but toys and rocks still careened around in unnatural flight.

Some of the toys even spoke when hitting things, all the same feminine voice:

- â€œUp, up, away!â€
- â€œDown is upâ€”float forever!â€
- â€œDonâ€™t hold too close!â€

### Get People Out!

The group started working on a plan to retrieve the floating victims.

Idris tied himself to Viola, who braced herself and walked across the effect, sticking to the ground with her abilities. Step by step, Idris was plunged into the zoneâ€”dodging toys and debris as best he could. After a series of hard knocks to the head, he managed to pull out almost everyone, including Dalia Vos, who appeared in several overlapping formsâ€”glitching in and out.

Nickolas, Abokar, and Tobin worked in parallel to construct a long pole with a hooked end. After a few iterations, it workedâ€”they used it to snag Tilda and pull her back to safety.

With Idris exhausted, Ruby took over. She handed Nickolas the Bag of Colding containing the shard and entered the zone. Compared to Idris, she moved like an expertâ€”swiftly rescuing the last two people without issue.

### The Effect Moves, Then Fades

At some point, the groupâ€™s efforts triggered a shift.

The field began to move, drifting slowly in their direction. But as it moved, its power lessenedâ€”until, finally, everything dropped. Carts gently lowered, rocks and toys landing to the earth once more.

They calmed the panicked horses and flipped the wagons upright. Idris, ever the opportunist, managed to swipe both a glowing rock and one of the speaking toys during the rescue.

### Barnaby â€œBarnieâ€ Fizzlewick

One of the caravan leaders, Barnabyâ€”â€œBarnieâ€ to mostâ€”was healed by Idris but clearly shaken. He lashed out at Garron, the other caravan leader, demanding to know what *he* had done to his toys.

Strangely, some of the toys still floated on their ownâ€”even outside the field.

Barnie admitted this floating was normal. The toys were crafted in Whitestone, and there *had* been rumors that under certain conditions they acted... unpredictably. But those were just stories. Nothing had ever happened like *this*.

Competition trying to discredit them, maybe?

Idris calmed everyone down. As thanks, Barnie handed over a few of the curious toys to Idris for helping him and his bodyguard escape.

## **Session 27: Why is there a ship here?**

### Barnaby â€œBarnieâ€ Fizzlewick

Barnaby's guardâ€”who revealed his name as Tomas to Abokarâ€”was busy collecting all the toys and putting them back into crates. Abokar, who was helping out, was baffled that the toys wouldnâ€™t stay down. Tomas explained this was normal for these toysâ€”apparently, theyâ€™re meant for rich kids. That might be true, as Idris asked if he could buy one of the toys from Barnaby, who enthusiastically picked one up off the ground, dusted it off, and sold it to Idris for 2 gold.

Barnaby once again insisted theyâ€™re perfectly safe. This strange behavior had never happened before, and he wasnâ€™t sure what caused such... explosive reactions.


### Idris Experiments

Idris, now in possession of the floating doll, approached everyone to see if it would react. Nothing happenedâ€”until he neared Dalia. The moment the doll was brought close to her, it suddenly whipped out of his hands and shot over 60 feet into the air. Everyone looked stunned as they watched the doll slowly float back downâ€”at which point Abokar caught it mid-air.

### Quantum Interactions?

Meanwhile, Ruby had gone to recover the weapons, which were apparently stored near Daliaâ€™s body. She walked a short distance away from the caravans, waiting for Dalia to shift into her "living" quantum state before using the quantum shard to collapse realities into one where the painted weapons had never been created.

However, as she waited, Barnieâ€™s caravan began moving againâ€”heading closer to Rubyâ€”when she noticed the weapons on the ground vibrating more and more violently. At the same time, the shard in her hand began to hum and slightly vibrate. Putting two and two together, Ruby quickly called out for Barnie to stop! She warned him that proximity to what she was doing could cause another explosion.

Barnie wisely decided not to ask further questions. With help from Nickolas, Abokar, and Tomas, they cleared away some brush so Barnieâ€™s caravan could go off-road and avoid Rubyâ€™s position.

### Collapse!

A scream cut through the airâ€”Dalia, alive again and without wounds, screamed in horror. Ruby wasted no time. Focusing her will and mind through the shard, she saw infinite possibilities and realities, picked the right quantum state, plucked its string, and collapsed reality into that version. The weapons in front of her vanishedâ€”either never having existed or erased in that moment. Dalia, now being tended to by Tilda the healer, slowly calmed down, though she remained in shock. She no longer seemed dead, nor reverted to her prior state.

### Travel Continues

The group rejoined the caravan heading toward Westruun, and several days passed. Ruby remained entranced by the bright star in the night sky, never fully able to resist its strange pull. Abokar noticed that as the days went on, and they traveled closer to Westruun, the star seemed to grow brighter and higher in the sky.

At one point, discussing this with Garron, the man remarked that it almost looked like something above Westruun itself. Abokar focused his keen sight on the now-closer starâ€”just as a cloud passed in front of it, dimming the lightâ€”and noticed a shape. It looked like... a sail-less ship?

A discussion followed. The concept of airships wasn't unfamiliar to those whoâ€™d traveled through major trade citiesâ€”but none had ever heard of one glowing or causing strange trances like this. The mystery remained.

### Tobin Wants to Fly Without Magic

At one point, Nickolas asked Tobin what he kept tinkering with during the travels. Tobin excitedly showed him a small prototype made of parchment, string, and wood. He aimed and threw itâ€”everyone watched as it floated and flew a good distance before landing harshly on its tip with a crack.

Blushing, Tobin admitted he needed to figure out the landing part. He explained that if he could make it work, he could build one large enough to strap to his back andâ€”by jumping off a mountainâ€”cover great distances at high speed, all without magic. Ruby teased that teleportation magic was still faster, but Nickolas was intrigued and began helping Tobin refine the design.

### Idris Discovers Somethingâ€”at a Cost

At night, Idris couldnâ€™t stop thinking about the dolls and the strange magic surrounding them. Burning with curiosity, he tried to experiment during his watchâ€”but Garron, who was on watch with him, caught him and firmly forbade it. He told Idris to wait until morning and to include the others, away from the caravan. Garronâ€™s priority was keeping everyone safe.

Idris claimed he didnâ€™t mind going further away right now, but Garron reminded him he was part of the caravan.

As Garron became distracted by the distant riders with torchesâ€”patrolling the wilderness like they had for many nightsâ€”Idris seized the moment. He pulled out the stolen unrefined hum dust from Rubyâ€™s bag and rubbed it against the head of the floating doll.

Immediately, there was a flash. The doll catapulted skyward at great speed, and Idris screamed in pain as his finger disintegrated.

### The Group Awakens to Theorize

Garron, alerted by the sound and flash, shouted everyone awake. Abokar jumped up, ready for battle. The rest of the caravan, on edge, saw Garron harshly admonishing Idris for his recklessness.

It quickly became clear Idris had lost a finger. He triedâ€”somewhat successfullyâ€”to convince a few people it was an accident, but others saw through it. Ruby, discovering her stolen hum dust, was livid and demanded it back. Idris had hidden it in his bedroll, claiming it stung too much when kept in his pocket.

Abokar noticed the toy slowly falling back down. Its head was disintegrated. Even worseâ€”it now lay flat on the ground, no longer hovering.

Ruby used her quantum shard to cast *Detect Magic*. She confirmed the dollâ€™s magicâ€”and the hum dustâ€™sâ€”were completely gone.

Nickolas, having seen there was no danger, had already gone back to sleep.

Ruby continued experimenting and shared her thoughts: the dolls didnâ€™t use quantum magic. Her shard identified it as *Graviton*â€”not really a traditional school of magic, but something deeper. It appeared to interact poorly with the quantum magic of the shard and the paint.

Now, she also noticed the hum dust had reacted differentlyâ€”it held magic she identified as *Entropy*.

She had now encountered three unfamiliar "flavors" of magic: **Quantum**, **Graviton**, and **Entropy**â€”none of which she had heard of before.

### Almost to Westruun

The group continued traveling. The endless grass fields gave way to pine forest: the Bramblewood Forest, a vast woodland encircling Westruun. They began seeing more trafficâ€”lumberjacks, loggers, and farmers heading to large fields. Many asked about the strange star or the supposed sky ship.

From passing Pale Guardsâ€”Westruunâ€™s official armyâ€”they learned the star was actually *The Brown Beacon*, a skyship captained by Elowen Blythe. She was described as pragmatic and profit-driven. But no one knew why the ship was so bright or why it had been hovering for several days.

### Ambush?

A dayâ€™s travel from Westruun, they noticed *The Brown Beacon* wasnâ€™t hovering above the city, but over the forest to their left. Just then, they heard the breaking of branches and rustling of leavesâ€”something rushing toward them.

Everyone preparedâ€”axes ignited, bows drawn, mage armor cast. But from the woods burst two elite-looking Pale Guards, bloodied and escorting a severely wounded lumberjack.

The guards, recognizing the partyâ€™s readiness, immediately ordered themâ€”by command of Margrave Lysandra Kallosâ€”to assist in rescuing the rest of their unit, still fighting in the forest.

Abokar, recognizing them as genuine, rushed ahead. Idris, Ruby, and Nickolas asked questions, to which the guards urgently explained: the forest itself was hostile. They had been sent to investigate when the *trees* attacked.

One guard, unwilling to wait longer, turned and ran back toward the battle. Bram Gulley from the caravan joined them. Nickolas stayed behind with Tilda to tend the injured logger.

### A Very Angry Tree

The group followed the guards into the forest. Along the way, the guards explained that a massive tree decimated their unit. They brought the logger for his forestry expertise.

But words weren't necessary.

Suddenly, the pine forest gave way to jungleâ€”massive leaves, humid air, moonlight shining from no discernible source, even in places that should be in shadow.

They hacked through jungle undergrowth until they saw two Pale Guards thrown overheadâ€”dead.

They arrived just in time to fight a massive treant. Three soldiers already lay dead, one barely clinging to life. With quick healing, the survivor was saved, and the party brought down the glowing-eyed treant before it could summon others.

### A Startling Discovery

After the fight, Abokar and Bram helped gather the fallen soldiers. The captain refused to leave them behind.

Ruby, scouting the perimeter, noticed something strange: she was walking on a large, flat plank, overgrown with jungle flora. Looking around, she realized a â€œboulderâ€ was actually curved woodâ€”planks of a ship.

She shouted to the others that sheâ€™d found a *ship* buried in the jungle.

Perplexed, the group and guards followed and indeed found what looked like a ship, far from any ocean.

Idris climbed up and spotted sails and a mast. Ruby, examining the wood, grew paleâ€”it came from her homeland, Xhorhas.

Once she climbed up, she recognized the design. This was one of the rare military skyships built by the Krynn Dynastyâ€”for speed.

She kept this quiet from the guards. As Idris found a hatch leading below, Abokar cracked it open with Betty.

As Idris descended into the darkness, Ruby quietly told Abokar:

> â€œI think... this might be a ship of the Aurora Watch.â€

## **Session 28: The Beacon Flies Off**

### A Flashback of Research

Nickolas and Viola remained behind with the caravan, keeping watch alongside Garron, Dalia, Tilda, and Tobin.  
Viola found herself reflecting on the past few days of travel, poring over the research notes of Arnaud and later Halen Greystone.

The earliest pages recounted Arnaud's growing concerns about the strange behavior of the Pluntard family over the years, culminating in his final decision regarding Viola. Seeing everything written down, it became clear Arnaud had tried to document how the family's magical talentsâ€”originally used with noble intentionsâ€”had ended up causing harm to those around them. 

Strangely, Pluntard family members began to show signs of erratic behavior and eventual madness. Toward the end of the records, some family members and close companions were dying slowly, bleeding from the eyes and ears over several weeks. Arnaudâ€™s notes gradually shifted from blaming the magic itself to suspecting an external influence at play.

When Viola reached the point where Halen joined the research, she noticed that his role was often to answer Arnaudâ€™s questions and offer supporting evidence. Yet Halen frequently veered off-track, compiling a long list of magical and non-magical illnesses, curses, rot, and corruptive substances. The notes felt like an ongoing exchange of lettersâ€”passing research back and forth rather than collaborating side-by-side.

Halenâ€™s tangents often explored strange pigments and colors he could extractâ€”or couldn't. Arnaud focused more on the symptoms and impacts of the illnesses themselves.

One illness eventually caught Violaâ€™s attentionâ€”"Blood Fever." Marked prominently in the pages, it was described by Halen as a condition that temporarily boosted intelligence while causing chaos and madness. Victims would bleed from their eyes and eventually succumb to an extremely high fever.

Further along in the notes, they referenced a similar condition called **Typhros**, said to affect only the nobility of the Krynn Dynasty. Though seemingly a well-kept secret, Halen had recovered old letters from citizens describing the queen bleeding light and blood from their eyes while behaving erratically.

The final entries suggested that what they were observing might not be a disease or curse, but rather a bodily rejectionâ€”too much of something overwhelming the body, manifesting in similar symptoms.

### Investigating the Ship

Meanwhile, Idris descended into the dark hold of a small airship, stranded in what was once a forest but now resembled a jungle. Below deck, he found broken crates and barrelsâ€”one of which contained surprisingly fresh beer from Xhorhas, indicating the ship hadnâ€™t been there long despite the encroaching vines.

Ruby joined the search and discovered four hammocks. There were no signs of a struggle. The ship hadnâ€™t crashedâ€”it had simply been... left behind.

Back on the deck, Ruby's memories of the ship sharpened. She noticed a missing arcane core from the pedestal that normally powered flight. Curious, she retrieved the Quantum Shard and placed it into the socket without any reaction. Suddenly A blinding flash of light erupted from above them.

### Strange Movements of the Brown Beacon

That light caught Abokarâ€™s attention. High above, the **Brown Beacon**, a skyship that had previously hovered motionless above the forest, was suddenly moving erraticallyâ€”zigzagging and rotating before abruptly accelerating toward them.

Then it happened.

The Beacon straightened out and shot forward like a blazing comet. Its light flared like a second sun as it descended lower and faster than ever before. Abokar's backpack began shaking violently. Before he could react, the **doll** heâ€™d bought from the TumbleToys merchant days ago burst out and launched into the sky.

At the same time, the vial containing a sample of **EternaYouth** aged instantlyâ€”its contents crumbling into dust.

The Beacon roared overhead. Everyone was forced to shield their eyes from the blinding brilliance. Around them, the jungle exploded with growth, twisting the terrain into something nearly unrecognizable and impassable.

### A Cat Stuck in a Tree

Below deck, Idris had hidden in the sleeping chambers, his backpack vibrating ominously. Before he could react, vines erupted from the backpack, wrapping around him. He cried outâ€”alerting the others.

Rushing to help, the group faced a **shambling mound**, a sentient mass of vines and roots, lashing out and trying to devour them. After a fierce fight of steel, spell, and will, they brought the creature down.

In the aftermath, Idris recovered most of his belongingsâ€”except for a **quantum branch** he had once collected from the great tree beside the goblin fortress. It had vanished.


### A Body Falls From the Sky

Back with the caravan, Nickolas and Viola used the brief moment they had to push the cart and horses into cover beneath the trees. They watched in awe and dread as the Brown Beacon raced overhead at breakneck speed toward the fields beyond.

As the shockwave passed, the landscape morphed. Pines twisted into massive jungle trees, thick with vines and broad leaves. Then, without warning, something crashed nearby.

A corpse lay on the ground, clad in strange, exotic armor. Viola and Nickolas investigated, but found no identifying itemsâ€”only that it was a human male, dead from multiple stab wounds, likely inflicted *before* the fall.

### Interrogating the Corpse

Guided by the eagle spirit Viola had summoned, the rest of the group carved their way back through the jungle to the caravan. When they regrouped, they shared storiesâ€”and gathered around the fallen body.

Ruby went pale. She recognized the armor: **Aurora Watch.** Someone had been hunting her for years. She tried to sneak away but stayed close enough to listen.

Idris used his mystic abilities to commune with the dead, asking three questions:

**"What were you doing on the ship?"**  
> *Mutiny. I tried to stop a war between the Dynasty and Tal'Dorei, but failed. Taskhand Verin Thelyss went mad after going blind. He stole the ship.*

**"Why were you here?"**  
> *We were hunting the traitor Ruby Krynn. She stole a Divine Beacon from the Dynasty. She betrayed the Queen.*

**"Why did you steal the ship?"**  
> *We believe the Divine Beacon is aboard. We can feel it. It belongs to usâ€”it was stolen, and we are reclaiming it.*

### Ruby Tries to Run

Hearing this, Ruby attempted to slip away quietly, fearing how both the Pale Guards from Westruun and her companions might react. But she was spotted.

Instead of hostility or interrogation, her companions simply... talked to her. No threats. No chains. Just questions. Perhaps this *wasnâ€™t* the Ruby the Aurora Watch sought. Or maybe she was being framed.

Then the Pale Guard captain stepped in.

He confirmed that the Aurora Watch had indeed been in the cityâ€”asking questions, hunting Rubyâ€”until the Brown Beacon returned. After that, they suddenly claimed Ruby Krynn was dead and began frequent meetings with the **Margrave** and the captain of the Beacon.
